Ian Stewart's "17 equations that changed to world" takes an historical tour of the most fundamentl, influential and important equations in mathematics. He ranges from pure geometry in the form of Pythagoras' theorem, to physics, with relativity and Schrodinger's equation, and even the world of finance, ending with the Balck-Scholes equation.

Each chapter builds on what has gone before, reminding the reader that without calculus or fourier transfroms, our understanding of thermodynamics and *put somehting else in here* could not exist. Especially for the lay reader, this helps to remind *one* that even the most abstract ideas are used in day to day life, if indirectly. It also gives an incredibly nice feel continuity - rather than feeling like an endless string of facts, one thinks of a web of ideas, and the more one reads the more one can put these ideas in a larger context.


Particular highlights include the Balck-Scholes equation. In the last chapter of the book Ian Stewart takes great care to show the very real effects that one equation can have on the world (no matter how abstract it may look). He points out how the now ubiquitous global financial problems were predicted in mathematics community,
