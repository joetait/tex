I found the Characteristic p methods in algebraic geometry an incredibly useful and enjoyable conference to attend. It had a great mixture of background and research focussed talks.

The majority of lectures covered known material, with the aim of showing PhD students key topics in the area. This was done well, with a good balance struck between giving background information and focussing on key, difficult points. Many differing aspects of the area were considered, such as the minimal model program in positive characteristic and the Frobenius map, and plenty of time was taken to answer questions from the audience clearly and in detail. In particular, both James McKernan and Karl Schwede gave numerous lectures. This allowed for them to really get in to the details of more complex topics without having to worry about confusing people by assuming too much knowledge.

An excellent feature were the exercises provided relating to the lectures that day. The exercises were provided by James McKernan and Karl Schwede, who were also present in the exercise sessions to give suggestions and elucidate points that may have been missed earlier. The exercises broke up the schedule and consolidated the material that had been discussed throughout the day.

Other senior participants gave more research focussed talks, showing some newer topics and adding a considerable amount of breadth to the proceedings. It was especially good to see the relations between current research and the more foundational aspects that were shown to us throughout the week. It was also great to see applications of the work, and connections with other disciplines. One such application, discussed by Nick Shepherd-Barron, was recent work he had been undertaking to find a mathematical base for current coding theory methods being used in engineering and security. He showed how this led from questions in positive characteristic birational geometry to questions about coxeter groups.

The workshops also offered PhD students the chance to present work. I was able to give a talk, which was an excellent opportunity to showcase my current research. It also gave good opportunities to discuss various research topics that are related to those of both other students and present academics. There was also a poster session, maximising the number of people who were able to benefit by sharing their work. It was especially nice that this was on the first day, as everyone was able to get a good judgement of what other peoples areas were for the rest of the week.

Overall, I found the conference both enjoyable and very informative. I would like to thank the LMS for funding the event.
