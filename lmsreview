I found the Characteristic p methods in algebraic geometry an incredibly useful and enjoyable conference to attend.

The majority of lectures were on known material, witht the aim of showing PhD students key topics in the area. This was done well, with a good balance being struck between giving background information and focussing on key points. Different perspectives were given on areas (examples), and plenty of time was given to answer questions clearly.

An excellent feature was the opportunity to to look at exercises related to the the days lectures. There were discussed in groups and kindly provided by ___ and _______, who were present in the sessions to give suggestions and elucidate points that may have been missed earlier.

Other senior participants gave more research focussed talks, showing some more current topics and adding a great amount breadth to the proceedings. It was especially good to see the relations between current work and the more foundational aspects that were shown to us throughout the week.

The workshops also offered PhD students the chance to present. I was personally able to give a talk, as were other participants, which was an excellent opportunity to showcase my current research. It also gave good opportunity to discuss various research topics that are related with both other students and present academics. There was also a poster session, maximising the amount of people who were able to benefit by sharing their work. It was especially nice that this was on the first day, as everyone was able to get a good judgement of what other peoples areas were for the rest of the conference.
