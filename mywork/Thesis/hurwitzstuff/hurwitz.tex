\section{The Riemann-Hurwitz formula}\label{Hurwitzsection}

Let $X$ and $Y$ be two projective non-singular curves over an algebraically closed field $k$, with a map $\pi \colon X \rightarrow Y$ of degree $n$.
We let $g_X$ and $g_Y$ be the genera of $X$ and $Y$ respectively.
Let $K(X)$ and $K(Y)$ be the function fields of $X$ and $Y$ respectively.
Note that $K(X)$ is a degree $n$ extension of $K(Y)$, and recall that $\pi$ induces a map $\pi^*\colon K(Y) \rightarrow K(X)$.
As usual, for any $P \in X$ and $Q \in Y$ we denote the local ring formed by functions which are regular at $P$ and $Q$ by $\cO_{X,P}$ and $\cO_{X,Q}$ respectively.

We recall some facts from Galois theory.
Any element $\alpha \in K(X)$ defines a $K(Y)$~-~linear map $\mu_{\alpha} \colon  K(X) \rightarrow K(X)$, given by multiplication by $\alpha$.
We let $\Tr_{X/Y}(\alpha)$ be the trace of the matrix corresponding to $\mu_\alpha$.
We call $\Tr_{X/Y}(\alpha)$ the trace of $\alpha$, and $\Tr_{X/Y}$ is a map $K(X) \ra K(Y)$.
Note that $\Tr_{X/Y}$ is an additive map, and that for $\alpha \in K(Y)$ we have $\Tr_{X/Y}(\alpha) = n \alpha$.
Also, since our extension is Galois (and hence, in particular, separable) then the trace map is non-zero (see, for example, \cite[Appendix A]{stichtenoth}).\todo{more specific citation}
Finally, if $\alpha \in K(X)$ has minimum polynomial 
\[
 f(X) = X^r + a_{r-1}X^{r-1} + \ldots +a_0 \in K(Y)[X]
\]
 and $s= [K(X):K(Y)(\alpha)]$, then $\Tr_{X/Y}(\alpha) = -sa_{r-1}$ as in \cite[Appendix A]{stichtenoth}.\todo{more specific citation}

Given a basis $\{z_1,\ldots,z_n\}$ of $K(X)$ over $K(Y)$, we now introduce its dual basis with respect to the trace.
We denote the dual space of $K(X)$ over $K(Y)$ by \[K(X)^*:=\{\lambda \colon K(X) \rightarrow K(Y)| \lambda\ \text{is}\ K(Y)\text{-linear}\}.\]
We make $K(X)^*$ in to a one-dimensional $K(X)$-vector space by defining $z \lambda(w):=\lambda(z w)$.
As $\Tr_{X/Y}$ is non-zero, then there exists a unique $z\in K(X)$ for every $\lambda \in K(X)^*$ such that $\lambda = z\cdot \Tr_{X/Y}$.
In particular, if we choose $\lambda_j\in K(X)^*$ such that $\lambda_j(z_i) = \delta_{ij}$ (the Kronecker symbol), then there exist $z_j^*$ such that $\lambda_j = z_j^*\cdot \Tr_{X/Y}$.
Hence
\[
 \Tr_{X/Y}(z_iz_j^*) = (z_j^*\cdot \Tr_{X/Y})(z_i) = \lambda_j(z_i) = \delta_{ij}.
\]
The elements $z_1^*, \ldots , z_n^*$ form the {\em dual basis} of $z_1, \ldots , z_n$.

We now briefly introduce differentials in terms of function fields.
Let $C$ be any projective, non-singular curve over $k$, with function field $K(C)$, and with genus $g_C$.
Then an {\em \adele on $C$} is a map $\alpha\colon  C \rightarrow K(C)$ such $\alpha(P) \in \cO_{X,P}$ for nearly all $P \in C$ (\ie all but a finite number of points).
We can view $\alpha$ as an element of $\prod_{P\in C}K(C)$, and we write $\alpha_P := \alpha(P)$.
We let the {\em \adele space} of $C$, denoted by $\cA_C$, be the space of all \adeles on $C$.
There is a canonical injection $K(C) \hookrightarrow  \cA_C$, defined by sending $x\in K(C)$ to the \adele $\alpha$ for which $\alpha_P =  x$ at each point $P\in C$.
The elements of $K(C)$ have natural valuations; for each $P\in C$ we choose a uniformising parameter $t\in \cO_{X,P}$, and we then define $v_P(x):=n$, where $n$ is the unique integer such that $x=ut^n$ for some unit $u\in \cO_{X,P}$.
We can we can then extend this valuation to elements of $\cA_C$ by defining $v_P(\alpha) := v_P(\alpha_P)$.

Recall that a divisor on $C$ is a finitely supported formal sum over $C$, with coefficients in $\mathbb Z$, which we write as 
\[
 D = \sum_{P\in C} n_P [P],
\]
and that the degree of such a divisor $D$ is 
\[
 \deg(D) := \sum_{P\in X} n_P.
\]
We then define the order of $D$ at $P$ to be $v_P(D) := n_P$.

We let $\cD_C$ be the space of divisors of $C$.
Note that for any $x\in K(C)$ we have a naturally associated divisor, which is
\[
 \di(x) := \sum_{P\in C} v_P(x) [P].
\]

For any $D\in \cD_C$ we define $v_P(D)$ to be the coefficient of $[P]$ in $D$, and we let
\[
 \cA_C(D):=\{\alpha \in \cA_C | v_P(\alpha) \geq -v_P(D)\ \text{for all} \ P\in C\}
\]
be the {\em \adele space associated to $D$}.
Then we define a {\em differential} on $C$ to be a $k$-linear map $\omega\colon  \cA_C \rightarrow k$ such that $\omega$ is zero on $\cA_C(D) +K(C)$ for some divisor $D\in \cD_C$.
Note that via the canonical embedding of $K(C)$ into $\cA_C$, we can view $\cA_C(D) +K(C)$ as a subspace of $\cA_C$.
We will denote the space of differentials on $C$ by $\Omega_{K(C)}$.

Now we define 
\[
 M(\omega) := \{ D\in \cD_C | \omega \ \text{is zero on }\ \cA_C(D) + K(C)\}
\]
for any non-zero $\omega \in \Omega_{K(C)}$, and state the following lemma.

\begin{defnlem}
 For any non-zero differential $\omega$ on $C$ there is a unique maximal divisor $W$ in $M(\omega)$, which we call the {\rm canonical divisor associated to $\omega$} (we associate the zero divisor to $0\in \Omega_{K(C)}$).
 We denote the divisor associated to $\omega$ by $\di (\omega)$.
 We call a divisor a {\rm canonical divisor} if it is the canonical divisor associated to some $\omega \in \Omega_{K(C)}$.



 Given any two non-zero canonical divisors, $W$ and $W'$, there exists an $x\in K(C)$ such that $W = W' + \di(x)$.
 Conversely, if $W$ is a canonical divisor, and $x\in K(C)$, then $W + \di(x)$ is a canonical divisor.
\end{defnlem}
\begin{proof}
 See \cite[Lem. 1.5.10 and Prop. 1.5.13]{stichtenoth}.\todo{check citations}
\end{proof}

\todo[inline]{Introduce the idea of "the" canonical divisor $K_X$ here}
We can now define valuations on the differentials; namely, given some differential $\omega $ on $X$, and its associated divisor $W$, we set $v_P(\omega):=v_P(W)$ for $P\in X$.




\begin{prop}
 The space of differentials, $\Omega_{K(C)}$, is a one-dimensional vector space over $K(C)$.
\end{prop}
\begin{proof}
 See \cite[Prop. 1.5.9]{stichtenoth}.\todo{check citation}
\end{proof}



It should be noted that in algebraic geometry differentials are normally defined in a different, but equivalent, manner.
Given a ring $K(X)$ and an $K(X)$-module $M$, we call any $K(X)$-linear map $D\colon K(X)\rightarrow M$ satisfying \[D(ab) = aD(b) + D(a)b\] for all $a,b\in K(X)$ a {\em derivation}.
There is a unique module, denoted $\Omega_{K(X)}$, with a map $d\colon K(X) \rightarrow \Omega_{K(X)}$, which every derivation must factor through; \ie if $D\colon K(X)\rightarrow M$ is a derivation then there is a unique map $f\colon \Omega_{K(X)}\rightarrow M$ such that $D = f\circ d$.\todo{change $f$}
Given any differential $\omega$, we can write it as $fdx$ for some $x$ and some $f$ in $K(X)$.
This is how we will consider differentials in the other sections of this report.
At the end of this section we will describe an isomorphism between $\Omega_C$ and $\Omega_{K(C)}$.

Finally, we define a particular class of differentials that will play a crucial role in what follows.
A differential $\omega \in \Omega_{K(X)}$ is called {\em holomorphic} if its associated divisor, $W$, is non-negative (\ie if $v_P(W) \geq 0$ for all $P\in X$).
We denote {\em the space of holomorphic differentials} by $H^0(X,\Omega_{K(X)})$.\todo{Change notation - $\Omega_{K(X)}$ is not a sheaf}
Also, for any divisor $D$ on $X$ we define 
\[
H^0(X,\cO(D)) := \{x\in K(X) | v_P(x) \geq -v_P(D)\}\cup \{0\}.
\]\todo{change this notation to Fulton's or Stichtenoth's}
This is sheaf theoretic notation, which would not normally be used in function field theory, but we use it for consistency with the rest of the report.\todo{change this sentence after changing notation}
We can now state the celebrated Riemann-Roch theorem.

\begin{thm}[Riemann-Roch]\label{riemannroch}
Let $W$ be a canonical divisor on $C$.
Then for any divisor $D$ on $C$ 
\[
 \dim H^0(C,\cO(D)) = \deg(D) + 1 - g_C + \dim H^0(C,\cO(W-D)).
\]
\end{thm}
\begin{proof}
 See, for example, \cite[8.6]{fulton} or \cite[Thm. 1.5.15]{stichtenoth}.\todo{check citations}
\end{proof}


\begin{cor}\label{dim=gc}
 For any canonical divisor $W$ on $C$, we have 
 \[
  \deg(W) = 2g_C-2
 \]
and \[
     \dim H^0(C,\cO(W)) = g_C.
    \]
\end{cor}
\begin{proof}
Since $\dim H^0(C,\cO(0)) = 1$ (recall that the only functions with no poles are the constant functions), we have by Riemann-Roch, $ 1= \dim H^0(C,\cO(0)) = 0 + 1 -g_C + \dim H^0(C,\cO(W))$.
 Rearranging this gives the second statement.
 The first statement then follows by rearranging
\[
 g_C = \dim H^0(C,\cO(W)) = \deg(W) + 1 -g_C +  \dim H^0(C,\cO(W-W))= \deg(W) + 1 -g_C + 1.
\]
\end{proof}


There is an alternative way to map $K(C)$ in to $\cA_C$, which we will make use of shortly.
Given a point $P\in C$ we define $\iota_P\colon K(C) \rightarrow \cA_C$ by
\begin{equation}
 (\iota_P(x))_Q:= \begin{cases}
           x & \text{if }\ P=Q\\
           0 & \text{otherwise}.
           \end{cases}
\end{equation}
for $Q\in X$.
For $\omega \in \Omega_{K(X)}$ we then define $\omega_P\colon K(X) \rightarrow k$ to be the map $\omega_P(x) := \omega(\iota_P(x))$.
This is called the {\em local component} of $\omega$; we will use these definitions to prove the following proposition.\todo{change this sentence}

\begin{prop}\label{propertyofomega}
 Let $\omega \neq 0$ be a differential on $X$ and let $P\in X$. Then
 \[
  v_P(\omega) = \max \{r\in \mathbb{Z}|\omega_P(x) = 0\ \text{for all} \ x\in K(X) \ \text{with}\ v_P(x) \geq -r\}.
 \]
In particular $\omega_P \neq 0$.\todo{make clear that the maximum exists and hence that this is well defined}
\end{prop}
\begin{proof}
 Let $W$ be the divisor associated to $\omega$.
 Let $s:=v_P(\omega)$ be the order of $\omega$ at $P$.
 If $x\in K(X)$ and $v_P(x)\geq -s$, then $\iota_P(x) \in \cA_X(W)$, by definition.
 Hence $\omega_P(x) = 0$.
 On the other hand, suppose $\omega_P(x) = 0$ for any $x\in K(X)$ satisfying that $v_P(x) \geq -s-1$.
 Let $\alpha\in \cA_X(W+[P])$.
 Then we have
 \[
  \alpha = (\alpha-\iota_P(\alpha_P)) + \iota_P(\alpha_P).
 \]
Note that $\alpha - \iota_P(\alpha_P)\in \cA_X(W)$ and $v_P(\alpha_P) \geq -s-1$.
Hence
\[
 \omega(\alpha) = \omega(\alpha-\iota_P(\alpha_P))  + \omega_P(\alpha_P) = 0,
\]
and so $\omega$ is zero on $\cA_X(W+P)$.
But this contradicts the maximality of $W$ in its definition.
 
\end{proof}



We now give a small result regarding field extensions, after recalling some terminology.
Recall that if $S$ is a subring of $R$, then an element $x\in R$ is integral over $S$ if there is a monic polynomial with coefficients in $S$ for which $x$ is a solution.
Then an integral basis of $R$ over $S$ is a basis of $R$ over $S$, for which each basis elements is integral.
 Recall that $\cO_{X,Q}$ is an integrally closed subring of $K(Y)$ for any $Q\in Y$, and that $K(Y)$ is the field of fractions of $\cO_{X,Q}$.


\begin{prop}
 For $z\in K(X)$ we let $\phi(T)\in K(Y)[T]$ be its minimal monic polynomial over $K(Y)$.
 Then $z$ is integral over $\cO_{X,Q}$ if and only $\phi (T)\in \cO_{X,Q}[T]$.
\end{prop}
\begin{proof}
 By definition $\phi(T)$ is the monic irreducible polynomial in $K(Y)[T]$ such that $\phi(z) = 0$. 
 Hence if $\phi (T)$ has coefficients in $\cO_{X,Q}$, then $z$ is integral over $\cO_{X,Q}$ by definition.
 
 We now suppose that $z\in K(X)$ is integral over $\cO_{X,Q}$.
 Then we can choose some monic polynomial $f(T)\in \cO_{X,Q}[T]$ such that $f(z) = 0$.
 Since $\phi(T)$ is minimal over $K(Y)$, then there exists some $\psi(T)\in K(Y)[T]$ such that $f(T) = \phi(T)\cdot \psi(T)$.
 Let $F \supseteq K(X)$ be a finite extension of $K(X)$ containing all the roots of $\phi$, and let $R$ be the integral closure of $\cO_{X,Q}$ in $F$.
 Now the roots of $\phi(T)$ are also roots of $f(T)$, and hence are in $R$.
 Then the coefficients of $\phi(T)$ can be written as polynomials of the roots of $\phi(T)$, and as we just noted that these roots are in $R$ then $\phi(T) \in R[T]$.
 But then $\phi(T)\in K(Y)[T]$, and since $R$ is integrally closed it follows that $K(Y)\cap R = \cO_{X,Q}$, hence $\phi(T)\in \cO_{X,Q}[T]$.
\end{proof}

\begin{cor}\label{traceinclosure}
Let $Q$ be a point in $Y$ and let $x\in K(X)$ be integral over $\cO_{X,Q}$ under $\pi$.
 Then $\Tr_{X/Y}(x)\in \cO_{X,Q}$.
\end{cor}
\begin{proof}
 As noted earlier, if $\phi(T)=T^r+a_{r-1}T^{r-1} + \ldots + a_0\in K(Y)[T]$ is the minimal polynomial of $x$ over $K(Y)$, then $\Tr_{X/Y}(x)=-n_xa_{r-1}$, where $n_x : = [K(X):K(Y)(x)]$.
 Hence the corollary follows from the previous proposition.
\end{proof}


We wish to define the ramification divisor, as this is essential for the statement of the Riemann-Hurwitz formula.
In order to do this we first define the complementary module and the ramification index.


\begin{defn}
 Consider a point $P\in X$ in the pre-image of $Q\in Y$ under $\pi$.
 By \cite[Prop. 3.1.4]{stichtenoth}\todo{check citations} there is an integer $e_P$ such that for any $x\in K(X)$ the equality $v_P(x) = e_P\cdot v_Q(x)$ holds.
 This value is called the ramification index of $P$.
 If $e_P>1$ then we say that $\pi$ is ramified at $P$.
\end{defn}

Given this we can associate to each $Q\in Y$ the divisor
\[
 \pi^*([Q]) := \sum_{P\mapsto Q} e_P [P].
\]
This can then be extended from a single point to a divisor on $Y$, in which case for a divisor $D = \sum_{Q\in Y}n_Q [Q]$ we have
\[
 \pi^*(D) := \sum_{Q\in Y}n_Q \pi^*([Q]).
\]

\begin{rem}
It should be noted that in the literature regarding function field theory, what we have denoted by $\pi^*(D)$ is normally called the conorm of $D$ and is denoted ${\rm Con}_{X/Y}(D)$. 
We used the notation above, from algebraic geometry, to be consistent with the rest of this report.
\end{rem}

\begin{defn}
 For any $Q\in Y$, let $\cO_{X,Q}'$ be the integral closure of $\cO_{X,Q}$ in $K(X)$.\todo{define this in text, remove instances in this and next lemma}
 We then define the complementary module over $\cO_{X,Q}$ to be
 \[
  C_Q :=\{z\in K(X) | \Tr_{X/Y}(z\cdot \cO_{X,Q}') \subseteq \cO_{X,Q}\}.
 \]\todo{is it okay to say $\Tr_{X/Y}(z\cdot \cO_{X,Q}')$?}
\end{defn}


We will list some properties of the complementary module in a proposition, but first we require the following lemmas.

\begin{lem}[Approximation lemma]\label{approximationlemma}
Let $m$ be a positive integer. 
For each $i\in \{1,\ldots, m\}$ let $P_i\in X$, let $\mathcal{P}_i$ be the corresponding maximal ideal of $\cO_{P_i}$, let $x_i$ be an element of $K(X)$ and let $n_i$ be an integer.\todo{fix line break}
Then there is an $x\in K(X)$ such that $v_{P_i}(x-x_i) \geq n_i$ for all $i$.
\end{lem}

\begin{rem}
This result can be strengthened to also say that $v_P(x) \geq 0$ for any $P\notin \{P_1,\ldots ,P_m\}$.\todo{fix line break}
We will not prove this here, for the sake of brevity, but the proof can be found in \cite[Chap. 1, \S 3, pg. 12]{localfields}.
\end{rem}
\begin{proof}
We let $R:= \cO_{P_i} \cap \ldots \cap \cO_{P_m}$, and we let $\mathcal{P}_i' := \mathcal{P}_i \cap R$.
We first prove the lemma assuming that $x_i \in R$.
 We may increase the $n_i$ such that $n_i\geq 0$ for all $i$.
 By linearity we may assume that $x_2 = \ldots = x_m = 0$, since if we find an element for $x_1$ in this instance, we can similarly find an element for each $i$ and add them.
Let $I = {\mathcal{P}_1'}^{n_1} + {\mathcal{P}_2'}^{n_2}\cdots {\mathcal{P}_n'}^{n_m}$.
This is an ideal of $R$, and since it has elements whose valuation at any $P_i$ is zero, it is in fact equal to $R$.
Hence we can write $x_1 = x + y$, where $y \in {\mathcal{P}_1'}^{n_1}$ and $x\in {\mathcal{P}_2'}^{n_2}\cdots {\mathcal{P}_n'}^{n_m}$.
Since ${\mathcal{P}_1'}^{n_1} \subseteq {\mathcal{P}_1}^{n_1}$ and ${\mathcal{P}_2'}^{n_2}\cdots {\mathcal{P}_n'}^{n_m} \subseteq \mathcal{P}_2^{n_2}\cdots \mathcal{P}_n^{n_m}$, the $x$ above is as described in the lemma, and this finishes the proof in the case $x_i \in R$.

 
 In general one can write $x_i = \frac{a_i}{b}$ for $a_i\in R$ and $b\in R\backslash \{0\}$, and $x$ can be represented as $\frac{a}{s}$.
 Then we require that $v_{P_1}(a-a_i) \geq n_i + v_{P_i}(s)$ for all $i$ and that $v_P(a)_ \geq v_P(s)$ for all $P\notin \{P_1,\ldots ,P_m\}$.
 But after adding the points $P$ for which $v_P(s)$ is negative, this is precisely what we described in the statement of the lemma.
 \end{proof}

\begin{lem}\label{pidlemma}
 Let $Q\in Y$, and let $\cO_{X,Q}'$ be the integral closure of $\cO_{X,Q}$ in $K(X)$.
 Then $\cO_{X,Q}'$ is a principal ideal domain.
\end{lem}
\begin{proof}
By \cite[Cor. 3.3.5]{stichtenoth}\todo{check citation}, we have $\cO_{X,Q}' = \{x\in K(X)|v_P(x) \geq 0 \ \text{for all} \ P\in \pi^{-1}(Q)\}$.
 Let $I$ be an ideal of $\cO_{X,Q}'$.
 If we let $\{P_1,\ldots, P_l\} = \pi^{-1}(Q)$ then we can choose $x_i$ for $1\leq i \leq l$ such that $v_{P_i}(x_i) \leq v_{P_i}(y)$ for all $y\in I$.
 By the Approximation Lemma there exist $z_i$ such that $v_P (z_i) = 0$ if $P=P_i$ and $v_{P_j}(z_i) > v_{P_j}(z_j)$ for $j\neq i$.
 Now let $x = \sum_{i=1}^l x_iz_i \in I$.
 Clearly $v_{P_i}(x) = v_{P_i}(x_i)$ for all $1\leq i\leq l$.



 Now we show that $I \subseteq x\cO_{X,Q}'$.
 If $y\in I$ then we let $z = x^{-1}y$.
 Then $v_{P_i}(z) = v_{P_i}(y) - v_{P_i}(x_i) \geq 0$ for all $1\leq i\leq l$.
Hence $z\in \cO_{X,Q}'$ and so $y = xz \in x\cO_{X,Q}'$, completing the proof.
\end{proof}


\begin{prop}\label{factsaboutc'}
Fix $Q\in Y$. 
 \begin{enumerate}
  \item $C_Q$ is an $\cO_{X,Q}'$-module, and $\cO_{X,Q}' \subseteq C_Q$.
  \item If $\{z_1,\ldots ,z_n\}$ is a (necessarily integral) basis of $\cO_{X,Q}'$ over $\cO_{X,Q}$, then 
  \[
   C_Q = \sum_{i=1}^n \cO_{X,Q}\cdot z_i^*,
  \]
where $z_i^*$ is the dual basis of $z_i$ for $1\leq i \leq n$.\todo{reference dual basis defined earlier}
\item There is a $t\in K(X)$ such that $C_Q = t\cdot \cO_{X,Q}'$ (note that $t$ depends on the choice of $Q$).
  Moreover, $v_P(t) \leq 0$ for all $P\in \pi^{-1}(Q)$, and if $t'\in K(X)$ then $C_Q=t'\cdot \cO_{X,Q}'$ if and only if $v_P(t) = v_P(t')$ for all $P\in \pi^{-1}(Q)$.

 \end{enumerate}
\end{prop}
\begin{proof}
 \begin{enumerate}
  \item It is clear that $C_Q$ is an $\cO_{X,Q}'$ module.
	Indeed, if $y\in \cO_{X,Q}'$, then $y\cdot \cO_{X,Q}' \subseteq \cO_{X,Q}'$ and hence $\Tr_{X/Y}(z y\cdot \cO_{X,Q}')\subseteq \Tr_{X/Y}(z\cdot \cO_{X,Q}') \subseteq \cO_{X,Q}$ for any $z\in C_Q$.
	The fact that $\cO_{X,Q}'$ is contained in $C_Q$ follows from Corollary \ref{traceinclosure}.
  \item We first show that $C_Q \subseteq \sum_{i=1}^n \cO_{X,Q}\cdot z_i^*$.
	Suppose $z\in C_Q$.
	Now $\{z_1^*, \ldots ,z_n^*\}$ is a basis of $K(X)$ over $K(Y)$, so there exist $x_1,\ldots , x_n\in K(Y)$ such that $z=\sum_{i=1}^n x_iz_i^*$.
	As $z\in C_Q$ and $z_1,\ldots ,z_n\in \cO_{X,Q}'$, it follows by definition of $C_Q$ that $\Tr_{X/Y}(zz_j)\in \cO_{X,Q}$ for $j\in \{1,\ldots ,n\}$.
	We know that 
	\[
	 \Tr_{X/Y}(zz_j) = \Tr_{X/Y}\left(\sum_{i=1}^nx_iz_iz_j^*\right) = \sum_{i=1}^nx_i \cdot \Tr_{X/Y}(z_iz_j^*) = x_j,
	\]
	since $z_j^*$ is dual to $z_j$.
	Hence each $x_j$ is in $\cO_{X,Q}$, and $z\in \sum_{i=1}^n\cO_{X,Q}\cdot z_i^*$.
	
	Now suppose that $z\in \sum_{i=1}^n\cO_{X,Q}\cdot z_i^*$ and $u\in \cO_{X,Q}'$.
	Then we need to show that $\Tr_{X/Y}(z u)\in \cO_{X,Q}$.
	We can find $x_i, y_j\in \cO_{X,Q}$ such that $z=\sum_{i=1}^n x_iz_i^*$ and $u=\sum_{i=1}^ny_jz_j$.
	Then
	\[
	 \Tr_{X/Y}(zu) = \Tr_{X/Y}\left(\sum_{i,j=1}^n \left(x_iy_jz_i^*z_j\right)\right) = \sum_{i,j=1}^n x_iy_j\cdot \Tr_{X/Y}(z_i^*z_j) = \sum_{i=1}^n x_iy_i.
	\]
	Since $\sum_{i=1}^n x_iy_i\in \cO_{X,Q}$, it follows that $z\in C_Q$.
  \item By the previous part, we can find $u_i\in K(X)$ such that $C_Q = \sum_{i=1}^n \cO_{X,Q} \cdot u_i$.
	Choose some $x\in K(Y)$ such that $v_Q(x)\geq 0$ and also $v_Q(x)\geq -v_P(u_i)$ for all $P\in \pi^{-1}(Q)$ and $i\in \{1,\ldots ,n\}$.
	By definition of $e_P$ it follows that
	\[ v_P(xu_i) = e_Pv_Q(x) + v_P(u_i) \geq 0\]
	for all $i\in \{1,\ldots, n\}$ and all $P\in \pi^{-1}(Q)$.
	Since $\cO'_Q = \cap_{P\mapsto Q} \cO_{X,P}$ (see, for example, \cite[Cor. 3.3.5]{stichtenoth}), then $x\cdot C_Q \subseteq \cO_{X,Q}'$.
	Since $\cO_{X,Q}'$ is a principal ideal domain by Lemma \ref{pidlemma}, it follows that $x\cdot C_Q = y\cdot \cO_{X,Q}'$ for some $y\in \cO_{X,Q}'$.
	If we let $t=x^{-1}y$ then $C_Q =t\cdot \cO_{X,Q}'$, proving the first part of the statement.



	Since $\cO_{X,Q}'\subseteq C_Q$ then $v_P(t)\leq 0$ for all $P\in \pi^{-1}(Q)$.
	Now $t\cdot \cO_{X,Q}' = t'\cdot \cO_{X,Q}'$ if and only if both $tt'^{-1}$ and $t^{-1}t'$ are in $\cO_{X,Q}'$.
	But this is the case if and only $v_P(tt'^{-1}) \geq 0$ and $v_P(t^{-1}t')\geq 0$ for all $P\in \pi^{-1}(Q)$, which is equivalent to $v_P(t)=v_P(t')$ for all such $P$.
 \end{enumerate}
\end{proof}

\begin{prop}\label{almostallqiny}
 For almost all $Q\in Y$ we have $C_Q= \cO_{X,Q}'$.
\end{prop}
\begin{proof}
 We first show that, given a basis of $K(X)$ over $K(Y)$, it is almost always integral over $\cO_{X,Q}$ given $Q\in Y$.
 Recall that $\cO_{X,Q}$ is integrally closed in $K(Y)$, and its quotient field is $K(Y)$.
 As before, we denote by $\cO_{X,Q}'$ the integral closure of $\cO_{X,Q}$ in $K(X)$, and we consider a basis $\{z_1,\ldots ,z_n\}$ of $K(X)$ over $K(Y)$.
 Let $\{z_1^*,\ldots ,z_n^*\}$ be the dual basis.
 Now the minimal polynomials of $z_1,\ldots, z_n,z_1^*,\ldots z_n^*$ have finitely many coefficients in $K(Y)$.
 Hence if $S\subseteq Y$ is the set of poles of these coefficients, then $S$ is finite and for $Q\notin S$ then we have
 \[
  z_1,\ldots,z_n,z_1^*,\ldots, z_n^*\in \cO_{X,Q}'.
 \]

 
 
Now we assume that $\{z_1,\ldots ,z_n,z_1^*,\ldots z_n^*\}\subseteq \cO_{X,Q}'$ and then we show that 
\[
  \cO_{X,Q}' \subseteq \sum_{i=1}^n \cO_{X,Q}\cdot z_i^*.
\]

 If $z\in K(X)$ then there are $e_1,\ldots, e_n\in K(Y)$ such that $z=e_1z_1^*+\ldots +e_nz_n^*$.
 If $z\in \cO_{X,Q}'$ then $zz_j\in \cO_{X,Q}'$ for $1\leq j\leq n$, and hence $\Tr_{X/Y}(zz_j)\in \cO_{X,Q}$, by Corollary \ref{traceinclosure}.
 As
 \[
  \Tr_{X/Y}(zz_j) = \Tr_{X/Y}\left(\sum_{i=1}^n e_iz_jz_i^*\right) = \sum_{i=1}^ne_i\cdot \Tr_{X/Y}(z_jz_i^*) = e_j.
 \]
  Hence $e_j\in \cO_{X,Q}$, and $\cO_{X,Q}'\subseteq \sum_{i=1}^n\cO_{X,Q}\cdot z_i^*$.
  Since $\{z_1,\ldots, z_n\}$ also forms a basis we can run the same argument again to show that $\cO_{X,Q}'\subseteq \sum_{i=1}^n\cO_{X,Q}\cdot z_i$.
  
  We then have the following set of inequalities:
  \[
   \sum_{i=1}^n \cO_{X,Q}\cdot z_i \subseteq \cO_{X,Q}' \subseteq \sum_{i=1}^n\cO_{X,Q}\cdot z_i^* \subseteq \cO_{X,Q}'\subseteq \sum_{i=1}^n \cO_{X,Q}\cdot z_i.
  \]
Since $C_Q = \sum_{i=1}^n \cO_{X,Q}\cdot z_i^*$ by part 2 of Proposition \ref{factsaboutc'}, the result follows.
\end{proof}

We can now define the ramification divisor.


\begin{defn}
 For a point $Q\in X$ choose $t\in K(X)$ such that $C_Q = t\cdot \cO_{X,Q}'$, as in part 3 of Proposition \ref{factsaboutc'}.
 Then for any $P\in \pi^{-1}(Q)$ we define the different exponent to be $\delta_P := -v_P(t)$.
 By Proposition \ref{factsaboutc'} this is well defined, and by Proposition \ref{almostallqiny} it is almost always zero.
 Hence we can define the ramification divisor to be
 \[
  R := \sum_{P\in X} \delta_P [P].
 \]
\end{defn}

\begin{rem}
It should be noted that when considering the theory of function fields the ramification divisor is called the different, and denoted ${\rm Diff}_{X/Y}$.
\end{rem}

We now define the \adele space of $X$ over $Y$.

\begin{defn}
 We define $\mathcal {A}_{X/Y}$ as
 \[
  \mathcal{A}_{X/Y} := \{\alpha \in \mathcal{A}_X | \alpha_P =\alpha_{P'}\ \text{if}\ \cO_{X,P}\cap K(Y) = \cO_{P'}\cap K(Y)\}.
 \]
We extend the trace function $\Tr_{X/Y}\colon K(X)\rightarrow K(Y)$ to a map $\Tr_{X/Y}\colon \mathcal{A}_{X/Y} \rightarrow \mathcal{A}_Y$,  by letting
\[
 (\Tr_{X/Y}(\alpha))_Q := \Tr_{X/Y}(\alpha_P)
\]
for any $\alpha \in \mathcal{A}_{X/Y}$, $Q\in Y$ and $P\in \pi^{-1}(Q)$.

For any divisor $D$ over $X$ we define
\[
 \mathcal{A}_{X/Y}(D) := \mathcal{A}_X(D) \cap \mathcal{A}_{X/Y}.
\]

\end{defn}


\begin{defnthm}\label{detailedhurwitz}
 For every differential $\omega\in H^0(Y,\Omega_Y)$ there is a unique $\omega'\in H^0(X,\Omega_X)$ such that
 \[
  \omega'(\alpha) = \omega\left(\Tr_{X/Y}(\alpha)\right)
 \]
for all $\alpha \in {\mathcal A}_{X/Y}$.

This differential is called the {\rm pullback} of $\omega$, and is denoted $\pi^*(\omega)$. 
If $\omega\neq 0$ and $(\omega)$ is the associated divisor, then 
\[
 \di ( \pi^*(\omega)) = \pi^*(\di(\omega)) + R.
\]
\end{defnthm}
\begin{comment}
\begin{rem}
 In the language of algebraic geometry, where we would write differentials as $dx$ for some $x\in K(X)$, then this would be phrased differently.
 When we use the result in later sections, it will be written as
 \[
  \di (\pi^* (dx)) = \pi^*(\di (dx)) + R
 \]
for some holomorphic differential $dx$.

Also, it should be noted that in theory of function fields, what we have denoted by $\pi^*(\omega)$ is called the cotrace of $\omega$, and denoted ${\rm Cotr}_{X/Y}(\omega)$.
\end{rem}
\end{comment}
We first note that this immediately implies the Riemann-Hurwitz formula.




\begin{cor}\label{hur}[Riemann-Hurwitz Formula]
 Given two non-singular projective curves $X$ and $Y$ of genera $g_X$ and $g_Y$ respectively, with a degree $n$ map $f\colon X \rightarrow Y$, then
 \[
  2g_X - 2 = n(2g_Y -2) + \deg(R),
 \]
where $R$ is the ramification divisor of $f$.
\end{cor}
\begin{proof}
 This follows from Theorem \ref{detailedhurwitz} and Corollary \ref{dim=gc}, after taking degrees.
\end{proof}


We first give a lemma that is necessary for the proof of the theorem.


\begin{lem}\label{adelespacelemma}
 For any divisor $D$ over $X$ we have $\mathcal {A}_X = \mathcal{A}_{X/Y} + \mathcal{A}_X(D)$.
\end{lem}
\begin{proof}
 Let $\alpha \in \mathcal{A}_X$. Then by the approximation lemma there is an element $x_Q\in K(X)$ for each $Q\in Y$ such that 
 \[
  v_P(\alpha_P - x_Q) \geq -v_P(D)
 \]
for each $P\in \pi^{-1}(Q)$. 
We then define the \adele $\beta$ such that $\beta_P := x_Q$ for every $P\in \pi^{-1}(Q)$.
Then $\beta \in \mathcal{A}_{X/Y}$ and the difference $\alpha - \beta$ is in $\mathcal{A}_X(D)$ by definition of $\beta$.
Hence $\alpha = \beta + (\alpha - \beta) \in \mathcal{A}_{X/Y} + \mathcal{A}_X(D)$.
\end{proof}
\begin{comment}
\begin{lem}
 Let $V$ be a vector space over $K(X)$ and let $\mu\colon V\rightarrow K(Y)$ be a $K(Y)$ linear map.
 Then thee is a unique $K(X)$ linear map $\mu'\colon V\rightarrow K(X)$ such that $\Tr_{X/Y}\circ \mu' = \mu$.
\end{lem}
\begin{proof}
 {\bf is prop III.3.3 needed?}
 Let $K(X)^:=\{ \lambda\colon K(X) \rightarrow K(Y)| \lambda L-\text{linear}\}$ be the space of linear forms, which forms a vector space over $K(X)$.
 It is one dimensional over $K(X)$ {\bf (check why)}, and so any $\lambda \in K(X)^*$ can be written as $z\cdot \Tr_{X/Y}$ for some $z\in K(X)$.
 
 If we fix a $v\in V$ then we can define an $L$-linear map $\lambda \colon K(X) \rightarrow K(Y)$ as $\lambda_v(a)\mapsto \mu(av)$.
 So there exists a unique $z_v\in K(X)$ such that $\lambda_v = z_v\cdot \mu$, and we define $\mu'(v) := z_v$.
 Hence
 \[
  \mu(av) = (\mu'(v)\cdot \Tr_{X/Y})(a) = \Tr_{X/Y}(a\cdot \mu'(diffv))
 \]
for every $a\in K(X)$ and $v\in V$.
Since the trace function and $\mu$ are both linear, it follows that $\mu'$ is also.
If we let $a=1$ then the equality $\mu = \Tr_{X/Y} \circ \mu'$, which proves existence.
If there were another such map, say $\mu^*$, then the difference $\mu'-\mu^*\colon V\rightarrow K(X)$ would be surjective, but $\Tr_{X/Y}\circ (\mu'-\mu^*) = 0$.
This implies that $\Tr_{X/Y}=0$, a contradiction, hence $\mu'$is unique.
\end{proof}
\end{comment}
We now prove Theorem \ref{detailedhurwitz}.

\begin{proof}
 We first construct a differential $\omega'\in H^0(X,\Omega_X)$ for every $\omega\in H^0(Y,\Omega_Y)$ such that $\omega'(\alpha) = \omega(\Tr_{X/Y}(\alpha))$ for every $\alpha \in \cA_{X/Y}$.
 If $\omega = 0$ then we can clearly let $\omega' = 0$, so we assume that $\omega \neq 0$.
 We will use the following divisor, $W' := \pi^*(\di (\omega)) + R$, throughout the proof.
 
 We first prove two assertions about $\omega_1:= \omega\circ \Tr_{X/Y} \colon \mathcal{A}_{X/Y} \rightarrow k$.
 Namely, we show that
 \begin{enumerate}[(i)]
  \item For any $\alpha \in \mathcal{A}_{X/Y}(W') + K(X)$ then $\omega_1(\alpha) = 0$;
  \item If $B'$ is a divisor on $X$ with $B' \nleq W'$ then there is a $\beta \in \mathcal{A}_{X/Y}(B')$ such that $\omega_1(\beta) \neq 0$.
 \end{enumerate}
To show (i) we start by noting that since $\Tr_{X/Y}$ and $\omega$ are $k$-linear, $\omega_1$ is too.
Also, note that since $\omega$ is zero on $K(Y)$ then $\omega_1$ is zero on $K(X)$.
To show that $\omega_1(\alpha) = 0$ for any $\alpha \in \mathcal{A}_{X/Y}(W')$ then it is sufficient to show that for any $Q\in Y$ and $P\in \pi^{-1}(Q)$ that
\[
 v_Q(\Tr_{X/Y}(\alpha_P)) \geq -v_Q(\omega).
\]

We choose $x\in K(Y)$ such that $v_Q(x) = v_Q(\omega)$.
Then
\begin{align}\label{remark}
 & v_P(x \alpha_P) = v_P(x) + v_P(\alpha_P) \geq e_P v_P(\omega) - v_P(W') \nonumber \\
 & = v_P(\pi^*((\omega)) - W') = -v_P(R) = -\delta_P. 
\end{align}
By the definition of $C_Q$ and the ramification divisor, it is clear that $z\in C_Q$ if and only if $v_P(z)\geq -\delta_P$ for all $P\in \pi^{-1}(Q)$.
It then follows from \eqref{remark} that $x \alpha_P$ is in $C_Q$ and hence that $v_Q(\Tr_{X/Y}(x \alpha_P)) \geq 0$, by definition of $C_Q$.
Since $\Tr_{X/Y}(x \alpha_P) = x\cdot \Tr_{X/Y}(\alpha_P)$ and $v_Q(x) = v_Q(\omega)$, we have shown the first claim.

To show (ii) we let $Q_0\in Y$ be a point such that there is a $P^*\in \pi^{-1}(Q_0)$ with $v_{P^*}(\pi^*((\omega)) - B') < -\delta_P$.
We know that such a $Q_0$ exists since $B' \nleq W'$.
As before we will denote by $\cO_{Q_0}'$ the integral closure of $\cO_{Q_0}$ in $K(X)$.
We let 
\[
 J := \{ z\in K(X) | v_{P^*}(z) \geq v_{P^*}(\pi^*(\di (\omega)) - B')\ \text{for all}\ P^*\in \pi^{-1}(Q_0)\}.
\]
By the approximation lemma, there exists a $u\in J$ such that 
\[
 v_{P^*}(u) = v_{P^*}(\pi^*(\di (\omega))-B')
 \]
 for all $P^*\in \pi^{-1}(Q_0)$, and hence $J\nsubseteq C_{Q_0}$.
(As noted earlier, $z\in \cO_{X,Q}$ if and only if $v_P(z) \geq -\delta_P$).
It is clear that $J\cdot \cO_{Q_0} \subseteq J$, and hence that $\Tr_{X/Y}(J) \nsubseteq \cO_{X,Q}$.
We let $t$ be an element of $K(Y)$ such that $v_Q(t) = 1$.
Then there is an $r\in \mathbb N$ such that 
$t^r\cdot J \subseteq \cO_{X,Q},
 $
 and then \[ t^r\cdot \Tr_{X/Y}(J) = \Tr_{X/Y}(t^r\cdot J) \subseteq \cO_{X,Q}.\]
It is clear that $t^r\cdot \Tr_{X/Y} (J)$ is an ideal of $\cO_{X,Q}$, and so $\Tr_{X/Y}(J) = t^s\cdot \cO_{X,Q}$ for some negative integer $s$.
Hence 
\begin{equation}\label{traceinring}
 t^{-1}\cdot \cO_{X,Q} \subseteq \Tr_{X/Y}(J).
\end{equation}
By Proposition \ref{propertyofomega} we can find an $x\in K(Y)$ such that $v_Q(x) = -v_Q(\omega) - 1$ and $\omega_Q(x) \neq 0$.
If we choose $y\in K(Y)$ such that $v_Q(y) = v_Q(\omega)$, then $xy \in t^{-1}\cO_{X,Q}$.
Hence by \eqref{traceinring} there is a $z\in J$ such that $\Tr_{X/Y} (z) = xy$.
Let $\beta \in \mathcal{A}_{X/Y}$ be chosen  such that 
\begin{equation*}
 \beta_P = \begin{cases}
            y^{-1}z & \text{if}\ P\in \pi^{-1}(Q) \\
            0 & \text{otherwise}.
           \end{cases}
\end{equation*}
Then for any $P\in \pi^{-1}(Q)$ we have
\begin{align*}
 v_P(\beta) & =  -v_P(y) + v_P(z) \\
 & \geq  -v_P(\pi^*(\di (\omega))) + v_P(\pi^*(\di (\omega)) - \beta) \\
 & =  -v_P(B'),
\end{align*}
with the inequality following from the definition of $y$ and $J$.
Hence $\beta \in \mathcal{A}_{X/Y}(B')$.
Now $\omega_1(\beta) = \omega(\Tr_{X/Y}(\beta)) = \omega_Q(x) \neq 0$.
This shows (ii).

By Lemma \ref{adelespacelemma} for each $\alpha \in \mathcal{A}_X$ there exists some $\beta \in \mathcal{A}_{X/Y}$ and $\gamma \in \mathcal{A}_X(W')$ such that $\alpha = \beta + \gamma$.
We now define a new differential $\omega_2 \colon  \mathcal{A}_X \rightarrow k$ by letting $\omega_2(\alpha) := \omega_1(\beta)$.
Suppose we have two representations of $\alpha$, say $\beta+ \gamma$ and $\beta' + \gamma'$, where $\beta, \beta' \in \mathcal{A}_{X/Y}$ and $\gamma, \gamma' \in \mathcal{A}_{X}(W')$.
Then 
\[
  \beta - \beta' = \gamma' - \gamma \in \mathcal{A}_{X/Y} \cap \mathcal{A}_X(W') = \mathcal{A}_{X/Y}(W').
\]
It then follows from (i) that 
\[
 \omega_1(\beta) - \omega_1(\beta') = \omega_1(\beta - \beta') = 0.
 \]
and hence $\omega_2$ is well defined.
It is also clear that $\omega_2$ is $k$-linear.
Also, by the first two points we proved, (i) and (ii), we have:
\begin{enumerate}[(i$'$)]
 \item $\omega_2(\alpha) = 0$ for all $\alpha \in \mathcal{A}_X(W') + K(X)$.
 \item If $B'$ is a divisor on $X$ such that $B'\nleq W'$ then there is a $\beta \in \mathcal{A}_X(B')$ with $\omega_2(\beta) \neq 0$.
\end{enumerate}


Now it follows that for $\alpha \in \mathcal{A}_{X/Y}$ we have $\omega_2(\alpha) = \omega_1(\alpha) = \omega(\Tr_{X/Y}(\alpha))$.
This means that we have found the $\omega'$ in the statement of the theorem; namely $\omega' = \omega_2$.

It is clear from (i$'$) and (ii$'$) that $\di(\omega') = W' = \pi^*(\di(\omega)) + R$.

We finally prove the uniqueness of $\omega'$.
Suppose that $\omega''$ also satisfies 
\[
 \omega''(\alpha) = \omega(\Tr_{X/Y}(\alpha))
\]
for all $\alpha\in \cA_{X/Y}$.
So if we let $\theta = \omega'' - \omega'$, then $\theta(\alpha) = 0$ for all $\alpha \in \cA_{X/Y}$.
But then if we choose a large enough divisor $D$ in Lemma \ref{adelespacelemma}, this implies that $\theta = 0$ and $\cA_X$, and hence $\omega' = \omega''$.
\begin{comment}
If $\omega = 0$ this is clear.
The order of the differential at any point can be determined by the equality of divisors,
\[
(\pi^*(\omega) ) = \pi^*((\omega)) + R.
\]
If differential is a unit at a point, it's precise value can be determined by the equality
\[
\omega'(\alpha) = \Tr_{X/Y}(\omega(\alpha)).
\]

\begin{comment}
We now show the equivalence of our two definitions of differential.

Recall that for a curve $C$ a derivation of $K(C)$ is a $k$-linear map $d\colon K(C) \rightarrow M$ for some $K(C)$-module $M$ such that $d(ab) = ad(b) + d(a)b$ for all $a,b\in K(C)$.
Note that of course, as $K(C)$ is a field, $M$ is a vector space, but this does hold more generally for rings and modules.

By \cite[Prop. 4.1.4]{stichtenoth}, for each $x\in K(C)\backslash k$ there exists a unique derivation $d_x\colon K(C) \rightarrow K(C)$ such that $d_x(x) = 1$, which we call the {\em derivation with respect to $x$}.

If we let $Z:= \{(u,x)\in K(C)\times K(C) |x\notin k\}$, then we can define a relation on the elements of $Z$ by letting $(u,x) \sim (v,y)$ if $v = u\cdot d_y(x)$.
Then we denote the equivalence class of $(1,x)\in Z$ by $dx$.
It can then be shown that $Z$, when quotiented by the above relation, has the universal property of $\Omega_C$, and hence is isomorphic to $\Omega_C$ as a $K(C)$-module (see \cite[Prop. 4.1.8]{stichtenoth}).
\end{comment}

Let $C$ be a smooth, projective, connected algebraic curve over $k$.
We now show that our two different definitions of $\Omega_{K(C)}$ give rise to isomorphic differentials.
Recall that $K(x)$ is the field of rational functions of the projective line.
By \cite[Prop. 1.7.4]{stichtenoth} there exists a unique differential $\omega \in \Omega_{K(x)}$ such that $\di (\omega) = -2[P_{\infty}]$ and $\omega(\iota_\infty(x^{-1})) = -1$, where $P_\infty \in \mathbb P_k^1$ is the point at infinity on the projective line.


Now for any $z\in K(C) \backslash k$ we have that $k(z)$ is isomorphic to $K(x)$.
Hence if we let $G$ be the Galois group of the extension $[K(C):k(z)]$ then the quotient curve $Y:=X/G$ is isomorphic to the projective line.
We let $f_z\colon C \rightarrow \mathbb P_k^1$ be the corresponding surjective map, and we denote the unique differential described above by $\omega_z$.
We then define $\delta\colon K(C) \rightarrow \Omega_{K(C)}$ to be the map such that if $z\in K(C)\backslash k$ then $\delta (z) := f_z^*(\omega_z)$ and if $y\in k$ then $\delta(y):=0$.
This then induces a map $\mu\colon \Omega_{K(C)} \rightarrow \Omega_{K(C)}$, defined by $z\cdot dx \mapsto z\cdot \delta(x)$·

\begin{thm}
The map $\mu\colon \Omega_{K(C)} \rightarrow \Omega_{K(C)}$ is an isomorphism.
\end{thm}
\begin{proof}
See \cite[Thm. 4.3.2]{stichtenoth}.
\end{proof}

We now define the order of a poly-differential at a point.
If we consider an element of the tensor product $\omega \in \Omega_X^{\otimes m}$ then it can be locally written as $y dx_1\otimes \ldots \otimes dx_m$, where $x_i \in K(X)$ for all $1 \leq i \leq m$.
Let $P$ be a point in $X$.
Since each $dx_i$ can be written as $y_i dt$ for some $y_i\in K(X)$ and some uniformising parameter $t$ at $P$, we can rewrite $\omega$ as $y' dt \otimes \ldots \otimes dt$, where $y' = y \cdot y_1 \cdots y_m$.
We then define the order of $\omega$ at $P$ to be $\ord_P(\omega ) := \ord_P(y')$.
In the particular case where $\omega = fdx \otimes \ldots \otimes fdx = f^m dx^{\otimes m}$, then we have $y_1 = \ldots = y_m = z$ for some $z$ when we change $x$ to a uniformising parameter.
Hence in this instance \[ \ord_P(\omega) = \ord_P(z^m) = m\ord_P(z) = m\ord_P(dx).\]
