\section{Hyperelliptic curves, characteristic unequal to 2}\label{charneq2}
Let $X$ be a smooth, projective, connected, hyperelliptic algebraic curve of genus $g$ over an algebraically closed field $k$, with $\cha (k) \neq 2$.
Let $x:X\rightarrow \mathbb{P}_k^1$ be the corresponding holomorphic map of degree $2$.
This curve then has a corresponding degree two extension $k(x,y)$ of the rational function field in one variable over $k$, $K(\mathbb P_k^1) = k(x)$, where
   \begin{equation}\label{definingequation}
   y^2 = f(x)
   \end{equation}
for some $f(x)\in k[x]$ with no repeated roots (see, for example, \cite[Rem. 7.4.25]{liu}).
Also, the degree of $f(x)$ must be $2g+1$ or $2g+2$, as will be shown in the next paragraph.
In the first case then $\infty \in \mathbb P_k^1$ will be a branch point, where as in the second case it is not.

We now show some preliminary results about $x$. 
Firstly, $x$ is ramified at precisely $2g + 2$ branch points.
This follows from computing the degree of the ramification divisor $R$ of $x$.
By the Riemann-Hurwitz formula, Corollary \ref{corhurwitzformula},
    \[ 
    \deg(R) = 2g -2 +2\cdot 2 = 2g + 2.
    \]
Since $x$ is of degree $2$ and at most tamely ramified, the coefficients of the ramification divisor are $1$ (see the start of Section \ref{dimsection}), and hence $R = p_1 + \ldots + p_{2g+2}$, for distinct $p_i\in X$.
We let $a_i = x(p_i)$ and $D_i = \di_{a_i}(x)$.
Moreover, for a general point $a \in \mathbb P_k^1$ we let $D_a = \di_x(x)$.
We now show that the ramification points correspond to the zeroes of $f(x)$.
Since there are no repeated roots in $f(x)$, then \eqref{definingequation} defines a non-singular affine curve $X'$, with a degree two projection $x': X'\rightarrow \mathbb A_k^1$.
Clearly for any point $a\in \mathbb A_k^1$ which is not a solution to $f(x)$, then there are two points in the pre-image, namely $(a,\pm \sqrt{a})$, and the point is not ramified.
On the other hand, if $a\in \mathbb A_k^1$ is a solution to $f(x)$, then there is only one point in the pre-image and hence it is ramified.
Since there are $2g+2$ solutions of $f(x)$, and the degree of $R$ is $2g+2$, then we conclude that these are all the ramification points.

Next we will need to define precisely what the divisor of a poly-differential is.
If we consider an element of the tensor product $\omega \in \Omega_X^{\otimes m}$ then it can be locally written as $y dx_1\otimes \ldots \otimes dx_m$, where $x_i \in K(X)$ for all $1 \leq i \leq m$.
Let $P$ be a point in $X$.
Since each $dx_i$ can be written as $y_i dt$ for some $y_i\in K(X)$ and some uniformising parameter $t$ at $P$, we can rewrite $\omega$ as $y' dt \otimes \ldots \otimes dt$, where $y' = y \cdot y_1 \cdots y_m$.
We then define the order of $\omega$ at $P$ to be $\ord_P(\omega ) := \ord_P(y')$.
In the particular case where $\omega = fdx \otimes \ldots \otimes fdx = f^m dx^{\otimes m}$, then we have $y_1 = \ldots = y_m = z$ for some $z$ when we change $x$ to a uniformising parameter.
Hence in this instance 
    \[ 
    \ord_P(\omega) = \ord_P(z^m) = m\ord_P(z) = m\ord_P(dx).
    \]



    \begin{prop}\label{prophyperellipticbasispnot2}
    Let $m\geq 1$.
    Let $X$, $x$ and $y$ be as above, and let $\omega := \frac{dx^{\otimes m}}{y^m}$. 
    Then if $g\geq 2$, a basis of $H^0(X,\Omega_X^{\otimes m})$ is given by:
        \begin{itemize}
        \item $\omega, x\omega, \ldots , x^{g-1}\omega$ if $m=1$ 
        \item $\omega, x\omega, x^2\omega$  if $m=g=2$ 
        \item $\omega, x\omega, \ldots, x^{m(g-1)}\omega;\  y\omega, xy\omega, \ldots x^{(m-1)(g-1)-2}y\omega$ otherwise.
        \end{itemize}
    \end{prop}
    
    \begin{rem}
    Note that the case where $m=1$ is treated in \cite[Prop. 7.4.26]{liu} and \cite[Ch. IV, \S 4, Prop. 4.3]{griffiths}.
    \end{rem}
    
    \begin{proof}
    We first show that the elements are linearly independent over $k$.
    Since $\omega$ is fixed, it is equivalent to show that the coefficients are linearly independent over $k$ - \ie that $1,x,\ldots ,x^n, y, xy, x^ly$ are linearly independent over $k$ for any $n$ and $l$.
    But the only part of this which is not clear is when the coefficients are not just in $x$, but then it follows since the extension would otherwise be of degree 1.
    To show that they are indeed holomorphic differentials, we show that their divisors are greater than $0$.
    We first compute the divisors associated to $x$, $y$ and $dx^{\otimes m}$.
    
    Let $D_0 = [p']+[q']$ with $p',q' \in X$ (note that we could have $p' = q'$) be the divisor of zeroes of $x$. 
    Then $ i D_0$ is the divisor of zeroes of $x^i$. 
    If we also let $D_\infty = [p] + [q]$, with $p$ and $q$ defined as above, be the divisor of poles of $x$. 
    So overall $\di (x^i) = i D_0 - i D_\infty$.
    
    
    To compute $\di (dx^{\otimes m})$, we first note that it suffices to compute the divisor of $dx$, since $\di (dx^{\otimes m}) =m\di (dx)$, as noted above.
    Since $x$ can viewed as the projection of $X$ on to the projective line, or as a function on the projective line, we will use $\di_X (dx)$ and $\di_{\mathbb P^1} (dx)$ to differentiate these cases.
    We first recall that the Riemann-Hurwitz formula (Theorem \ref{theoremdetailedhurwitz}) tells us that
        \[
        \di_X (dx) = \pi^*( \di_{\mathbb P^1}(dx)) + R = R - 2D_{\infty},
        \]
    since $\di_{\mathbb P^1}(dx) = -2[\infty]$ and hence $\pi^* (\di_{\mathbb P^1}(dx)) = -2D_\infty$.
    
    Finally, we compute $\di (y)$.
    Since $\di (y^2) = \di (f(x))$ and hence $\di(y) = \frac{1}{2}\di(f(x))$, we need only compute the divisor of $f(x)$.
    As noted earlier, the solutions to $f$ correspond to the ramification points.
    So for any $P\notin x^{-1}(\infty)$ then $\ord_P(y) =  \frac{1}{2}\ord_P(f(x)) = 1$ if $P$ is a ramification point, and $\ord_P(y) = \frac{1}{2}\ord_P(f(x)) = 0$ otherwise.
    Finally, if $P\in x^{-1}(\infty)$, then $\ord_P(y)  = \frac{1}{2}\ord_P(f(x)) = - \frac{1}{2} (2g+2) = -(g+1)$.
    So, overall, we have 
        \[
        \di(y) = \sum_{i=1}^{2g+2} [p_i]- (g+1)D_\infty = R - (g+1)D_{\infty}.
        \]
    
    We now show that the differentials listed in Proposition \ref{prophyperellipticbasispnot2} are holomorphic.
    We consider the first two cases together.
    So if $m=1$ or $m\geq 2$, $g\geq 2$ then we have that
        \begin{align*}
        \di(x^i\omega) & =  \di \left( \frac{x^idx^{\otimes m}}{y^m} \right)\\ 
        & =  i(D_0 -D_\infty) + m(R-2D_\infty) -m(R-(g+1)D_\infty) \\
        & =  iD_0 + (mg -m -i)D_\infty \\
        & =  iD_0 + (m(g-1) -i)D_\infty,
        \end{align*}
    which is positive for $0\leq i \leq m(g-1)$.
    Note that if $m=g=2$ then there are three elements, and since $\dim_kH^0(X,\Omega_X^{\otimes 2})=3$ by Lemma \ref{dim3}, these elements form a basis.
    Also, if $m=1$ then by Riemann-Roch $\dim_k H^0(X,\Omega_X)=g$, and we have $g$ linearly independent elements, so they again must form a basis.
    
    
    
    Now we consider the case where $m\geq 2$ and $g \geq 2$ and at least one of these inequalities is strict.
        \begin{align*}
        \di (x^iy\omega) & =  \di(x^i\omega) + R -(g+1)D_\infty \\
        & =  iD_0 + R +((m-1)(g-1)-2-i)D_\infty,
        \end{align*}
    which is positive for $0\leq i \leq (m-1)(g-1)-2$.
    By Lemma \ref{dim3} we know that 
        \[
        \dim_kH^0(X,\Omega_X^{\otimes m}) = (2m-1)(g-1).
        \]
    Since the number of differentials listed in the last case of the proposition is precisely
        \[
        (m-1)(g-1)-1 + m(g-1) +1 = 2mg -2m -g + 1 = (2m-1)(g-1)
        \]
    it is clear that these elements form a basis.
    \end{proof}

We denote by $\sigma$ the automorphism of $X$ of order 2, which maps each point to its corresponding point in the pre-image of $x$.
Since $\sigma(y) = -y$, and $\sigma$ acts trivially on $x$, we can see that in the case where $m=g=2$ the action will be trivial, since the only power of $y$ is two, and of course $y^2 = (-y)^2$.
In any other case we have an odd power of $y$ in the basis, and hence the action of $\sigma$ is not trivial.
This proves the main theorem for hyperelliptic curves over a field of characteristic not equal to 2.




\section{Hyperelliptic curves, characteristic 2}
Let $X$ be a smooth, projective, connected hyperelliptic algebraic curve of genus $g$ over an algebraically closed field $k$ of characteristic two.
Let $\pi:X \rightarrow \mathbb P_k^1$ be the corresponding holomorphic map of degree two.
By \cite[Prop. 7.4.24]{liu} this curve has a corresponding degree two extension $k(x,y)$ of the function field of one variable over $k$, $k(x)$, where
    \begin{equation}\label{ext}
    y^2 - h(x)y = f(x)
    \end{equation}
for some polynomials $h(x), f(x)\in k[x]$, with maximum degrees of $g+1$ and $2g+2$ respectively.
We now show what conditions the smoothness of the curve imposes on $f(x)$ and $h(x)$.



    \begin{lem}\label{smoothness}
    Since the curve is smooth we have $h(x)$ and $h'(x)^2 f(x) + f'(x)$ have no common zeroes on $X$.
    \end{lem}
    \begin{proof}
    The Jacobian criterion (see, for example, \cite[Thm. 4.2.19]{liu}), states that if the derivatives of \eqref{ext} with respect to $x$ and with respect to $y$ are zero at a point $P\in X$ then the curve is not smooth, and otherwise it is.
    Clearly
        \[
        \frac{d}{dy} (y^2 -h(x)y -f(x)) = h(x)
        \]
    since the characteristic of $k$ is 2.
    On the other hand,
        \[
        \frac{d}{dx} (y^2 - h(x)y -f(x)) = h'(x)y - f'(x).
        \]
    Since this is zero if and only if its square is zero, $h(x)$ and $h'(x)^2 f(x) + f'(x)$ have a common zero if and only if
        \[
        (h'(x)y-f'(x))^2 = h'(x)^2y^2 -f'(x)^2 = h'(x)^2h(x)y + h'(x)^2f(x) - f'(x)^2
        \]
    and $h(x)$ are zero at some $P\in X$.
    But this is the case if and only if $h(x) = 0$ and $h'(x)^2f(x) + f'(x) = 0$ at $P$, which is what we wished to show.
    \end{proof}

By an automorphism of $\mathbb P_k^1$, similarly to the previous section, we can assume that $\infty\in \mathbb P_1^k$ is a branch point.
As will be shown, this means that the degree of $h(x)$ is strictly less than $g+1$.
By \cite[Prop. 7.4.24]{liu} this also forces the degree of $f(x)$ to be $2g+1$.
We will show that this also means that
Let $d$ be the degree of $h(x)$, and let $k< g+1$ be the number of distinct roots of $h(x)$ in $\mathbb A_k^1$.
We will denote by $\sigma$ the automorphism of order two on $X$, which sends each point to its corresponding point in the preimage of $\pi$. 
Note that we have $X/\langle \sigma \rangle \cong \mathbb P_k^1$.


We first describe the ramified points of $\pi$, in order to compute the ramification divisor.
By Lemma \ref{smoothness} if we consider the affine curve defined by this equation it will be smooth.
We denote this curve by $X'$.
Then $\pi$ restricts to a map $X'\rightarrow \mathbb A^1_k$, the projection on to the $x$ co-ordinate.
Let $a\in \mathbb A_k^1$.
Then if $(a,b)$ is a point in $\pi^{-1}(a)$, so is the point $(a,b+h(a))$, which is clearly distinct if and only if $h(a)\neq 0$.
Since the extension is degree two, this shows that the ramified points in the affine part correspond to the roots of $h(x)$.
We denote the zeroes of $h(x)$ by $a_i$ for $1\leq i \leq k$.
For each $a_i$ there is a corresponding $b_i$, which is the square root of $f(a_i)$.
We will also denote the corresponding ramification point by $P_i$.
If the point at infinity is also a branch point, the point that maps to infinity will be written $P_{\infty}$.

We will now compute the ramification divisor.


    \begin{lem}\label{char2ramification}
    Let $n_i$ be the order of $h(x)$ at $a_i\in \mathbb A_k^1$.
    Then the coefficient $\delta_P$ of the ramification divisor $R$ at $P\in X$ is given by
        \[
        \delta_P = \left\{
            \begin{array}{ll}
            2n_i & \text{if }\ P=P_i\ \text{ for some }\ i \in \{1,\ldots ,k\}, \\
            2(g+1-d) & \text{ if }\  P=P_\infty, \\
            0 & \text{ otherwise.} 
            \end{array}
        \right.
        \]
    \end{lem}
    \begin{proof}
    We first show that it will suffice to prove that the coefficient of $[P_i]$ is $2n_i$ for $1\leq i \leq k$.
    Note that by the Riemann-Hurwitz formula $\deg(R) = 2g+2$.
    Then the coefficient at $P_\infty$ is $\deg(R) - \sum_{i=1}^k2n_i$, which, by the Riemann-Hurwitz formula (Corollary \ref{corhurwitzformula}), is equal to $2g+2-2d = 2(g+1-d)$, as stated.
    
    Let $P=P_i$ for some $i\in \{1,\ldots , k\}$.
    Then $y-b_i$ is a local parameter at $P$.
    To see this, note that the maximal ideal $\mathfrak m_{P}$ of the local ring $\cO_{X,P}$ at $P$ is generated by $x-a_i$ and $y-b_i$.
    But $x-a_i\in \mathfrak m_{P}^2$ since $\pi$ is ramified at $P$ with ramification index 2.
    By Nakayama's lemma \cite[Prop. 2.6]{atiyahmacdonald},\todo{check citation} $y-b_i$ is therefore a local parameter at $P$.\todo{more specific citation}
    
    Using Hilbert's formula \cite[Chap. IV, \S 1, Prop. 4]{localfields} we obtain
        \begin{align*}
        \delta_P & =  \sum_{i\geq 0} \left(\ord(G_i(P))-1\right) \\
        & =  \max\left\{ i\in \NN | G_i(P)\neq \{1\}\right\} + 1 \\
        & =  \ord_{P}(\sigma(y-b_i) - (y-b_i)).
        \end{align*}
    
    By an argument similar to that used to show the correspondence between the solutions of $h(x)$ and the ramification points, it is clear $\sigma(y)=y+h(x)$.
    The following calculation then concludes the proof,
        \begin{align*}
        \delta_P & =  \ord_{P}(\sigma(y-b_i) - (y-b_i)) \\
        & =  \ord_{P}(y-b_i+h(x) - y + b_i) \\
        & =  2\ord_{a_i}(h(x)) \\
        & =  2n_i.
        \end{align*}
    \end{proof}



We will now compute the divisors associated to $h(x)$, $x$ and $y$ in $K(X)$, and also to $dx$.
If $a\in \mathbb P_k^1$ is a branch point, we denote the point in the pre-image by $P_a$, otherwise we denote the points in the pre-image by $P_a'$ and $P_a''$.
In order to simplify our calculations we let $D_a := \pi^*([a])$ for any $a\in \mathbb P_k^1$.
These will allow us to consider the case when 0 is or is not a branch point simultaneously. 
We now compute the divisors of all the elements required to form a basis of $H^0(X,\Omega_X^{\otimes m})$.

    \begin{lem}\label{xchar2}
    The divisor of $x\in K(X)$ is 
        \[
        \di (x)= D_0 - D_\infty.
        \]
    \end{lem}
    \begin{proof}
    Given our notations above, this is clear.
    \end{proof}


    \begin{lem}\label{dxchar2}
    Let $m\geq 1$.
    The divisor associated to the poly-differential $dx^{\otimes m}$ is 
        \[
        \di (dx^{\otimes m}) =mR + m(g-1-d)D_\infty
        \]
    \end{lem}
    \begin{proof}
    We first note that it suffices to compute $\di (dx)$, since $\di (dx^{\otimes m}) = m\di (dx)$, as described above.
    
    Now we compute the divisor of $dx$.
    We will need to consider the divisor of $dx$ both as a differential on $X$ and on $\mathbb P_k^1$. 
    We will use the notation of $\di_X(dx)$ and $\di_{\mathbb P^1}(dx)$ to differentiate between the two cases.
    Then the Riemann-Hurwitz formula (Theorem \ref{theoremdetailedhurwitz}) states that
        \[
        \di_X( dx) = \pi^*\di_{\mathbb P^1}(dx) + R.
        \]
    Now we have already computed $R$ in Lemma \ref{char2ramification}, and $\pi^*\di_{\mathbb P^1}(dx) = -2D_\infty$ hence we have
        \[
        \di_X( dx) = \sum_{i=1}^k 2n_iP_i + (g+1-d)D_\infty - 2D_\infty = \sum_{i=1}^k D_{a_i} + (g-1-d)D_\infty.
        \]
    Multiplying through by $m$ we obtain the desired result.
    \end{proof}



    \begin{lem}\label{h(x)char2}
    The divisor associated to $\frac{1}{h(x)}$ is
        \[
        \di \left(\frac{1}{h(x)}\right) = - \sum_{i=1}^k D_{a_i} + dD_\infty = dD_\infty - R
        \]
    \end{lem}
    \begin{proof}
    Since $\pi$ is ramified at infinity then $\ord_{P_{\infty}}\left(\frac{1}{h(x)}\right) = -\ord_{P_{\infty}}(h(x)) = 2d$.
    If it is not ramified, then $\ord_{P_{\infty}'}\left(\frac{1}{h(x)}\right) = \ord_{P_{\infty}''}\left(\frac{1}{h(x)}\right)=d$.
    For the ramified points $P_i$, $1\leq i \leq k$, then $\ord_{P_i}\left(\frac{1}{h(x)}\right) = -\ord_{P_i}(h(x))= -2n_i$.
    At any other point of $X$ the order of $\frac{1}{h(x)}$ is clearly zero.
    \end{proof}

We again consider the affine curve $X'$, and we let $\alpha_i \in \mathbb A_k^1$, for $1\leq i\leq l \leq 2g+1$, be the zeroes of $f(x)$.
If $\alpha_i$ corresponds to a branch point then we label the unique point in $X$ that maps to it $Q_i$.
Otherwise there are two points that map to it, and we denote these 
    \[  
    Q_i:=(\alpha_i,0)\ \text{ and}\ Q_i':=(\alpha_i,h(\alpha_i)).
    \]


    \begin{lem}\label{ychar2}
    Let $m_i$ be the order of $f(x)$ at $\alpha_i\in \mathbb A_k^1$.
    Then 
        \[
        \di(y) = \sum_{i=1}^l m_i[Q_i] - (2g+1)[P_\infty].
        \]
    \end{lem}
    \begin{proof}
    First note that if $P\in X'$ is not a zero of $f(x)$ (\ie $P\neq Q_i$ for any $i$), then it is clear that $y|_P \neq 0$.
    Indeed, if it were zero then $f(x)|_P = y^2 + h(x)y|_P = 0$, a contradiction.
    
    If $Q_i$ is not ramified then $h(\alpha_i) \neq 0$, and $y|_{Q_i} = 0$, hence $y+h(x)$ is a unit at $Q_i$.
    Since $y(y+h(x)) = f(x)$, we have
        \[
        \ord_{Q_i}(y) = \ord_{Q_i}\left(\frac{f(x)}{y+h(x)}\right) = \ord_{Q_i}(f(x)) -\ord_{Q_i}(y+h(x)) = m_i.
        \]
    
    This only leaves the case when $Q_i$ is ramified. 
    In this case we must have $m_i=1$.
    Otherwise we would also have $f'(x)|_{Q_i} = 0$, and since we also have $h(x)|_{Q_i} = f(x)|_{Q_i} = 0$ this would contradict Lemma \ref{smoothness}.
    So if we let $\tilde f(x) := \frac{f(x)}{x-\alpha_i}$ and $\tilde h(x) := \frac{h(x)}{x-\alpha_i}$ then $\tilde f(x)$ is a unit at $Q_i$.
    Then we have 
        \[
        y^2 = f(x) - yh(x) = (x-\alpha_i)(\tilde f(x) - \tilde h(x)y).
        \]
    Hence
        \[
        \ord_{Q_i}(y^2) = \ord_{Q_i}(x-\alpha_i) + \ord_{Q_i}(\tilde f(x) - \tilde h(x)y).
        \]
    But since $\tilde f(x) - \tilde h(x) y$ does not have an affine pole, and $\tilde f(x)$ is a unit at $Q_i$, and $Q_i$ is a zero of $\tilde h(x) y$, it follows that $\ord_{Q_i}(\tilde f(x) -  \tilde h(x) y) = 0$
    and hence $\ord_{Q_i}(y^2) = \ord_{Q_i}(x-\alpha_i) = 2$, and we have determined the zero divisor of $y$.
    
    Since there is only one point at which $y$ can have a pole, namely $P_\infty$, and since the degree of $\di (y)$ is zero, then we have the pole divisor must be $(2g+1)[P_\infty]$, and this completes the proof.
    \end{proof}



We now prove the following proposition, determining a basis of the space of global holomorphic poly-differentials as a vector space over $k$.

    \begin{prop}\label{propbasishyperellipticp=2}
    We assume that $g\geq 2$ and let $\omega:= \frac{dx^{\otimes m}}{h(x)^m}$. 
    Then if $g\geq 2$, a basis of $H^0(X,\Omega_X^{\otimes m})$ is given by
        $\begin{cases}
        \omega, x\omega, \ldots , x^{g-1}\omega &  \mbox{if}\ m=1 \\
        \omega, x\omega, x^2\omega & \mbox{if}\ m=g=2 \\
        \omega, x\omega, \ldots, x^{m(g-1)}\omega;\  y\omega, xy\omega, \ldots x^{(m-1)(g-1)-2}y\omega & \mbox{otherwise.}
        \end{cases}$

    \begin{proof}
    We first assume that above elements are holomorphic poly-differentials, and show that they then form a basis.
    To show that the elements are linearly independent over $k$ we need only show that the coefficients are, since $\omega$ is fixed.
    The only case where this is not clear is when the coefficients contain both $x$ and $y$ terms.
    But since the $y$ terms are all linear, and the extension is of degree two, it must follow that coefficients are linearly independent.
    
    
    In the case that $m=1$ then we have that $\dim_k H^0(X,\Omega_X) =g$ by Lemma \ref{dim3}, and there are $g$ elements described in the statement of the proposition in this case, so they must form a basis.
    If $m \geq 2$ then $\dim_k H^0(X,\Omega_X^{\otimes m}) = (2m-1)(g-1)$.
    If $m=g=2$ then $(2m-1)(g-1) = 3$, and there are three elements listed in the proposition.
    On the other hand if $m\geq 2$ and $g > 2$ the proposition lists
        \[
        m(g-1)+1 + (g-1)(m-1)-2+1 = 2mg -2m -g +1 = (2m-1)(g-1)
        \]
    elements, and again they must form a basis.
    
    We now show that the listed poly-differentials are holomorphic, \ie that their divisors are non-negative.
    Firstly we have
        \begin{align*}
        \di(x^i\omega) & =  \di \left( \frac{x^i dx^{\otimes m}}{h(x)^m} \right)\\ 
        & =  i(D_0 - D_\infty) +2m\sum_{i=1}^k n_i[P_i] + m(g-1-d)D_\infty\\
        &  -2m\sum_{i=1}^k n_i [P_i] + dmD_\infty \\
        & =  iD_0 + (m(g-1) -i)D_\infty
        \end{align*}
    by Lemmas \ref{xchar2}, \ref{dxchar2} and \ref{h(x)char2}, and this is clearly non-negative for $0\leq i \leq m(g-1)$.
    
    Similarly the divisor 
        \begin{align*}
        \di(x^iy\omega) & =  \di \left( \frac{x^i ydx^{\otimes m}}{h(x)^m} \right)\\ 
        & =  iD_0 + (m(g-1) -i)D_\infty + \sum_{i=1}^l m_i[Q_i] - (2g+1)[P_\infty] \\
        & =  iD_0 +  \sum_{i=1}^l m_i[Q_i] + (2m(g-1) -(2g+1) -2i)[P_\infty] \\
        & =  iD_0 +  \sum_{i=1}^l m_i[Q_i] + (2((m-1)(g-1) -1 -i)-1)[P_\infty]
        \end{align*}
    is again clearly non-negative for $0 \leq i \leq (g-1)(m-1)-2$.
    
    \end{proof}

Since $\sigma$ acts trivially on $x$, it is clear that in both the $m=1$ case and the case where $m=g=2$ that the group action is trivial.
On other hand, since $\sigma(y) = y+h(x)$, we can see that in the other cases the action is not trivial, as there are $y$ coefficients of the basis elements.
Hence this proves the main theorem in the case of hyperelliptic curves in characteristic two.
