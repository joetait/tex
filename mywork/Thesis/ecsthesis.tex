\begin{abstract}
In this thesis we consider the natural action of a subgroup $G$ of the automorphism group of a curve $X$ on spaces of differentials and similar algebraic structures.
We focus on curves over an algebraically closed field $k$ of characteristic $p >0$, and in particular on cases where $p$ divides the order of the group $G$ whose action we are considering.
There is also an emphasis on explicit examples and concrete computations throughout the thesis.

After covering background material we remind the reader of the details of hyperelliptic curves.  %We cover the case $p = 2$ in more depth, as details of this are less readily available in the literature.
We also give explicit bases for $H^0(X,\Omega_X^{\otimes m})$, the space of global polydifferentials of degree $m$.

We then apply our study of hyperelliptic curves by computing bases of $\hone$ and the first de Rham cohomology group of $X$, $\derhamhone$.
We make these computations via \cech cohomology, and by a careful choice of open covers of our curve $X$ can compute how specific automorphisms act on the de Rham cohomology basis.
We use this to determine when the natural exact sequence of $k[G]$-modules
    \[
    0 \ra \hzero \ra H^1_{\text{dR}}(X) \ra \hone \ra 0
    \]
splits in a particular case.
We also give a Mittag-Leffler style theorem for hyperelliptic curves, as a consequence to the basis of $\hone$ given.

We finally consider the question of when $G$ acts faithfully on the space $H^0(X,\Omega_X^{\otimes m})$, for any smooth projective curve $X$.
We give a complete and concise answer to this question, as well as extending the result to general Riemann-Roch spaces $H^0(X,\cO_X(D))$ where $D$ is a $G$-invariant divisor of degree at least $2g_X - 2$.
We finally use our earlier work for hyperelliptic curves to elucidate the main theorem.

He has always afforded the greatest amount of time and care in reading and annotating work, and especially in considering how mathematics may be extended and presentation improved. Lastly, I would like to thank Bernhard for never letting anyone else know that his understanding of my native language is clearly greater than mine. I would further like to thank both Gareth Jones and David Singerman for mathematical discussions.
