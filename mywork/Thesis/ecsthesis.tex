\begin{abstract}
In this thesis we consider the natural action of a subgroup $G$ of the automorphism group of an algebraic curve on spaces of differentials and similar algebraic structures.
We focus on curves over an algebraically closed field $k$ of characteristic $p >0$, and in particular on cases where $p$ divides the order of the group $G$.
There is also an emphasis on explicit examples and concrete computations throughout the thesis.

After covering background material about smooth projective curves we remind the reader of the details of hyperelliptic curves.  %We cover the case $p = 2$ in more depth, as details of this are less readily available in the literature.
Given a hyperelliptic curve $X$, we present an explicit basis for $H^0(X,\Omega_X^{\otimes m})$, the space of global polydifferentials of degree $m$.

We apply our study of hyperelliptic curves by computing bases of $\hone$ and the first de Rham cohomology group of $X$, $\derhamhone$.
We make these computations via \cech cohomology, and use them to determine the action of a specific automorphism $\tau$ of order $p$ on $\derhamhone$.
We then show that the natural short exact sequence of $k[\langle \tau \rangle]$-modules
    \[
    0 \ra \hzero \ra H^1_{\text{dR}}(X) \ra \hone \ra 0
    \]
does not split if $X$ is ramified above $\infty$.
We also give a Mittag-Leffler style theorem for hyperelliptic curves.

We finally consider the question of when $G$ acts faithfully on the space $H^0(X,\Omega_X^{\otimes m})$, for any smooth projective curve $X$.
We give a complete and concise answer to this question, as well as extending the result to general Riemann-Roch spaces $H^0(X,\cO_X(D))$ where $D$ is a $G$-invariant divisor of degree at least $2g_X - 2$.
Lastly, we use our earlier work for hyperelliptic curves to elucidate the main theorem.

%    I would first and foremost like to thank my supervisor, Bernhard K\"ock, for his great guidance and patience, both in matters of mathematics and style. He has always afforded the greatest amount of time and care in reading and annotating work, and especially in considering how mathematics may be extended and presentation improved. Lastly, I would like to thank Bernhard for never letting anyone else know that his understanding of my native language is clearly greater than mine. I would further like to thank both Gareth Jones and David Singerman for mathematical discussions.
