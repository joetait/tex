\maketitle

Let $C$ be a smooth, compact, connected hyperelliptic algebraic curve of genus $g$ over $\mathbb{C}$.
Let $x$ be a hyperelliptic map involution of $C$, i.e. a second degree holomorphic map $C\rightarrow \mathbb{P}^1$.

We now show some simple results about $x$. 
Firstly, $x$ has preciesly $2g + 2$ ramification points.
This follows from computing the degree of the ramification divisor $R$.
By the Hurwitz formula $\deg(R) = 2g -2 +2\cdot 2 = 2g + 2$.
Since $x$ is of degree $2$, the coefficients of the ramification divisor are at most $1$, and hence $R = p_1 \ldots p_{2g+2}$, for distinct $p_i$.
We let $a_i = x(p_i)$ and suppose $(x)_{\infty} = p + q$.
We can define $j\in \aut(C)$ to be the map defined $q_1 \mapsto q_2$ for $q_1, q_2 \in x^{-1}(a)$. 
Obviously this is the identity on the ramification points, and since $x$ is of degree $2$, $j^2 = 1$.
We will now use this to show the existence of one more function, $y$, which is necessary to define the basis of $\Omega_C$.

If we let $D = (g+1)p + (g+1)q$ be a divisor on $C$, then we can show that there exists a $y \in \cL(D)$ such that $j^* (y) = -y$.
To start, we have by the Riemann-Roch theorem that $l(D) = dim\cL(D) = (2g+2)-g+2 = g+3$.
So $\cL(D) \cong \mathbb{C}^{g+3}$.
Now since $x(p) = x(q) = \infty$, then $j(D) = D$ and $j^*$ defines a linear map $\cL(D) \rightarrow \cL(D)$.
Since $j^{*2} = 1$, the eiegenvalues must be $\pm 1$, and as such we can decompose $\cL(D)$ in to two subspaces, $\cL(D)^+$ and $\cL(D)^-$, corresponding the eigenspaces of eigenvalues $1$ and $-1$ respectively.
Note that $\cL(D) = \cL(D)^+ \oplus \cL(D)^-$.
Now any meromorphic function in $\cL(D)^+$ can be written as a composition of $x$ and a meromorphic function on $\mathbb{P}^1$, which will only have poles at $p$ and $q$ (i.e. the meromorphic function on $\mathbb{P}^1$ only has poles at infinity.)
The order of the pole at $p$ or $q$ cannot exceed $g+1$, hence $1,x,\ldots ,x^{g+1}$ forms a basis of $\cL(D)^+$.
As this implies that $\dim\cL(D)^+ = g+2$, and as $\dim\cL(D) = g+3$, we see that $\dim\cL(D)^- = 1$, and so there is a non-trivial meromorphic function $y \in \cL(D)$ such that $j^*(y) = -y$.
This is the $y$ we will use in the following Proposition to help define the basis.\\


\begin{prop}
$\omega_1 = \frac{dx}{y}, \omega_2 = \frac{xdx}{y}, \ldots , \omega_g = \frac{x^{g-1}dx}{y}$ form a basis of $\Omega_C^1$, with $C$, $x$ and $y$ as above.
\end{prop}
\begin{proof}
Clearly $\omega_1, \ldots , \omega_g$ are linearly independent.
To show that they are indeed holomorphic differentials, we show that their divisors are greater than $0$, i.e. that $(\omega_{\alpha}) \geq 0$ for all $1\leq \alpha \leq g$.
We first write the divisor as $(\omega_{\alpha}) = (x^{\alpha -1}) + (dx) - (y)$, and consider these seperate components one at a time.

First, suppose $(x)_0 = p'+q' = D'$. Then $(x^{\alpha -1})  = (\alpha - 1)D'$. Note that we could have $p' = q'$.

If we also let $D* = p + q$ then $(x^{\alpha - 1}) = (\alpha - 1)D*$, and so overall $(x^{\alpha - }) = (\alpha - 1)D' - (\alpha - 1)D*$.


We now look at $(dx)$. 
Let $z_i$ be a local coordinate map for $p_i$, with $z_i(p_i) = 0$.
Since $x$ is degree $2$, then $x - a_i = z_i^2h_i(z_i)$, where $h_i$ is a holomorphic map and does no vanish in a neighbourhood of $0$.
It follows that 
\[
 dx = 2z_ih_i(z_i) + z_i^2h_i'(z)dz_i = z_i(2h_i(z_i) + z_ih_i'(z_i))dz_i.
\]

Evalutating at $p_i$ we see that $2h_i(z_i) + z_ih_i'(z_i)|_{p_i} = 2h_i(0) \neq =0$, so $dx$ has a zero of order $1$ at each ramification point.
