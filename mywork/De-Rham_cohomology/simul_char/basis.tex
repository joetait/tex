\section{Background}

Let $X$ be a smooth, projective, connected hyperelliptic curve of genus $g \geq 2$ over an algebraically closed field $k$ of characteristic $p \geq 0$.
We  fix a map $\pi \colon X \rightarrow \mathbb P_k^1$ of degree two, which is unique up to an automorphism of $\mathbb P_k^1$.
We also suppose that we have a finite group $G$ acting faithfully on $X$.

In a similar vein to \cite{canonicalrepresentation}, we will be using \cech cohomology to compute both $\hone$ and the de-Rham hypercohomology, denoted $\derhamhone$.
We therefore recall the \cech cohomology relevant to both of these, starting with $\hone$.

By Leray's theorem \cite[Thm 5.2.12]{liu} and Serre's affineness criterion \cite[Thm 5.2.23]{liu} we know that the first \cech cohomology group and $\hone$ will be isomorphic if the cover we use to compute the \cech cohomology is affine.
The cover we shall be using is $U_1 = X\backslash \pi^{-1}(0)$ and $U_2 = X\backslash  \pi^{-1}(\infty) $, both of which are affine sets.
We let ${\cal U} = \{ U_1, U_2\}$.\todo{check indices}
Given any sheaf $\cal F$ on $X$ we have a canonical map ${\cal F}(U_1) \times {\cal F} (U_2) \rightarrow {\cal F}(U_1 \cap U_2)$, given by taking the difference, $(f_1,f_2) \mapsto f_1|_{U_1 \cap U_2} - f_2|_{U_1 \cap U_2}$.
In general we will not explicitly show \todo{wording}that we are considering the restriction when applying this map, unless it adds clarity.
It is this map which gives us the differential $d$ in the \cech cochain
\begin{equation*}
0 \rightarrow \cO_X(U_1)\times \cO_X(U_2) \xrightarrow{d} \cO_X(U_1 \cap U_2) \rightarrow 0.
\end{equation*}
The first cohomology group of this chain is $\cechhone = \frac{\cO_X(U_1 \cap U_2)}{\Ima(d)}$ and hence
\begin{equation}
\hone \cong \frac{\cO_X(U_1 \cap U_2)}{\Ima(d)}  
 = \frac{\cO_X(U_1 \cap U_2)}{\{f_1 - f_2 | f_i \in \cO_X(U_i) \}}.
\end{equation}
We will use this characterisation of $\hone$ later.\todo{repetition}

We now recall how to compute the algebraic de-Rham cohomology of $X$ via \cech cohomology.
The de-Rham cohomology of an algebraic curve is the hypercohomology of the de Rham complex on $X$. 
Since a curve doesn't have differentials of degree greater than one, this is just the hypercohomology of the complex
\begin{equation}\label{res}
0 \rightarrow \cO_X \rightarrow \Omega_X \rightarrow 0.
\end{equation}
\todo{explain the map here}

We then use the open cover $\cal U$ and the \cech differentials as defined earlier to give us the \cech complex of \eqref{res}, which is
\begin{equation}\label{bicomplex} \begin{array}{ccccccc}
~ & ~ & 0 & ~ & 0 & ~ & ~ \\
~ & ~ & \downarrow & ~ & \downarrow & ~ & ~ \\
0 & \rightarrow & \cO_X(U_1)\times \cO_X(U_2) & \rightarrow & \Omega_X(U_1)\times \Omega_X(U_2) & \rightarrow & 0 \\
~ & ~ & \downarrow & ~ & \downarrow & ~ & ~ \\
0 & \rightarrow & \cO_X(U_1 \cap U_2) & \rightarrow & \Omega_X(U_1 \cap U_2) & \rightarrow & 0 \\
~ & ~ & \downarrow & ~ & \downarrow & ~ & ~ \\
~ & ~ & 0 & ~ & 0 & ~ & ~ \\
\end{array}
\end{equation}
where the horizontal arrows are the standard differential map.
By a generalisation of Leray's theorem \cite[Cor 12.4.7]{EGA0III} we know that the $\derhamhone$ is isomorphic to the first cohomology of the total complex of \eqref{bicomplex}.
Note that this relies on $\cechhone$ and ${\check H}^p(\cU, \Omega_X)$ being zero for all $p\geq 1$ ---
since $U_1$ and $U_2$ are affine, this again follows from Serre's affineness criterion \cite[Thm 5.2.23]{liu}.\todo{check that cal U is correct, not U1 and U2}



After computing the first cohomology group of the total complex of \eqref{bicomplex} we see that $H^1_{{\text dR}}(X/k)$ is isomorphic to the space
\begin{equation}\label{derhamconditions}
\left\{(\omega_1, \omega_2, f_{12}) | \omega_i\in \Omega_{X/k}(U_i), f_{12}\in \cO_X(U_1 \cap U_2), df_{12} = \omega_1|_{U_1\cap U_2} - \omega_2|_{U_1\cap U_2} \right\}
\end{equation}
quotiented by the subspace
\begin{equation}\label{quotient}
\left\{  (df_1, df_2, f_1|_{U_1\cap U_2} -f_2|_{U_1\cap U_2} )|f_i \in \cO_X(U_i)\right\}.
\end{equation}

We wish to compute a $k$-basis of $\derhamhone$ in order that we can see how $G$ acts on $\derhamhone$ and to study the $k[G]$-module structure.\todo{are these reasons the only ones? Are they correct?}
To do this we will compute $k$-bases for the two outer terms of the short exact sequence
\begin{equation}\label{ses}
0 \ra H^0(X,\Omega_X) \ra \derhamhone \ra H^1(X,\cO_X) \ra 0.
\end{equation}

\todo{prove this is an SES/explain the maps}A basis of $H^0(X,\Omega_X)$ is already available in the literature (see, for example, \cite[Prop. 7.4.26]{liu}) so we need only compute a basis of $H^1(X,\cO_X)$.

\begin{comment}
In order to do this we will need to use Serre duality, which we briefly remind the reader of presently.
Serre duality states that $H^0(X,\Omega_X)$ and $H^1(X,\cO_X)$ are dual to each other, and that there is a canonical map ${\text Res}:H^0(X,\omega_X) \times H^1(X,\cO_X) \rightarrow k$.
Details of the definition of ${\text Res}$ can be found in appendix B of \todo{in progress}
\todo[inline]{add details - in particular, relate to the basis we have for de rham}
\end{comment}
\section{Basis of $\derhamhone$}

The bases of the $k$-vector spaces in \eqref{ses} will be given in terms of defining equations of the hyperelliptic curve $X$, so we describe these now.

If $p \neq 2$ then the extension $K(X)$ of $K(\mathbb P_k^1) = k(x)$ will be $k(x,y)$ where $y$ satisfies
\begin{equation}\label{definingequationpnot2}
y^2 = f(x)
\end{equation}
for some polynomial $f(x) \in k[x]$, of degree $2g+1$ or $2g+2$ \cite[Prop 7.4.24]{liu}.

For any $a\in \mathbb P_k^1$ we let $D_a$ denote the divisor $\pi^*([a])$.
Hence 
\begin{equation}\label{divisorofpoints}
D_a= 
\begin{cases}
 2[P_a] & \text{if $a$ is a branch point;} \\
 [P_a] + [P_a'] & \text{otherwise.}
\end{cases}
\end{equation}
with $P_a, P_a' \in X$.
With this notation we clearly have
\begin{equation}\label{divxp=2}
\di (x)  = D_0 - D_\infty.
\end{equation}
We then let $R$ be the ramification divisor of $\pi$, and recall that \todo{citation}
\begin{equation}\label{pnot2divisors}
\di(y)  = R - (g+1)D_\infty \text{ and } \di( dx) = R - 2D_\infty.
\end{equation}


If $p=2$, then the extension $K(X)$ will be $k(x,y)$, this time with $y$ satisfying the equation
\begin{equation}\label{definep=2}
y^2 - H(x)y = F(x),
\end{equation}
for some $H(x),F(x) \in k[x]$, such that $H(x)$ and $H'(x)^2F(x) + F'(x)^2$ share no roots.
We require that $\deg(H(x)) \leq g+1$, with equality if and only $\infty$ is not a branch point, and that $\deg(F(x)) \leq 2g+2$ with $\deg(F(x)) = 2g+1$ if $\infty$ is a branch point  \cite[Prop 7.4.24]{liu}.



Again, we let $R$ denote the ramification divisor, which we write explicitly below, and $D_a = \pi^*([a])$.
We now recall \todo{put in citation}the following divisors, which we will make use of throughout this article:
\begin{align}
\di (dx) & = R - 2D_\infty \label{divdxp=2}\\
\di (H(x)) & = R - (g+1)D_\infty \label{divhp=2}
\end{align}
We also use the divisor of $y$, which is as follows:\todo{citation, check wording}
\begin{equation}\label{divyp=2}
\di(y) = \begin{cases}
 \di_0(y) -(2g+1)[P_\infty] & \text{if $\infty$ is a branch point} \\
 \di_0(y) +(g+1-\deg(F(x)))[P_\infty] - (g+1)[P_\infty'] & \text{otherwise.}
\end{cases}
\end{equation}
\todo[inline]{define Pinfty'?? check the above, possibly prove}
Here $\di_0(y)$ denotes the divisor of zeroes of the function $y$.
Finally, we will compute the divisor of $dy$.
We start by noting that when we take the differential of \eqref{definep=2} we derive
\[
dF = d\left(y^2 + yH \right) = d(yH) = Hdy + ydH
\]
and from this follows 
\begin{equation}\label{divdyp=2}
dy = \frac{F'-yH'}{H}dx.
\end{equation}


To state the ramification points, and for later use, we suppose that 
\begin{equation}\label{hcoefficients}
H(x) = \prod_{i=1}^d (x-a_i)^{n_i} = x^d + b_{d-1}x^{d-1} + \ldots + b_1x
\end{equation}
for some $a_i, b_i \in  k$, $d \leq g+1$ and $n_i \in \mathbb N$.
Then the $a_i \in \mathbb P_k^1$ are the branch points of $\pi$ and we let $P_i \in X$ be the corresponding ramification points above $a_i$.
\todo[inline]{comment - ai are branch point of pi in Ak1 (contained in Pk1). Why do we need to do this}
Given this, we can write the ramification divisor as
\[
R = \sum_{i=1}^d 2n_i[P_i] + (g+1-d)D_\infty.
\]
Details can be found in \cite[\S 6]{faithfulaction}.\todo{will end up being references to other parts of thesis}

We now recall Serre duality, which we will use shortly to find a basis of $\hone$.
We recall\todo{cite when in thesis} that an {\sl ad\`ele} or {\sl r\'epartition} is a collection $\{r_P\}_{P\in X}$ of elements of $K(X)$ such that $r_P \in \cO_P$ for almost all $P\in X$, as in \cite[Chap. II, \S 5]{algebraicgroupsandclassfields}.
We let $R$\todo{change notation} denote the space of ad\`eles, and given a divisor $D = \sum n_P[P]$ we let $R(D)$ be the space of ad\`eles $r = \{r_P\}$ such that $\ord_P(r_P) \geq -n_P$ for all $P \in X$.
Note that one can embed the function field $K(X)$ into $R$.
Given any $f \in K(X)$ one defines $r \in R$ by setting $r_P = f$ for all $P \in X$, and this is clearly an injection.
Given this we can see that the quotient $R/(R(0) + K(X))$ is well defined, and Serre shows in \cite[Prop. 3, Chap II]{algebraicgroupsandclassfields} that $\hone$ is isomorphic to this quotient.

We now define the duality map in terms of ad\`eles.
Given some differential $\omega \in \hzero$ and some ad\`ele $r \in \hone$ we define 
\[
\langle \omega, r \rangle := \sum_{P\in X} \res_{P}( r_P\omega).
\]
Then if we fix any $\omega \in \hzero$ we get a map $\theta(\omega):\hone \rightarrow k$ given by $\theta(\omega)(r) = \langle \omega, r \rangle$.
Similarly, if we fix some $r \in \hone$ we get a map $\varphi(r):\hzero \rightarrow k$.
The duality theorem \cite[Thm. 2, Chap. II]{algebraicgroupsandclassfields} states that the maps $\theta$ and $\varphi$ are isomorphisms meaning that the spaces $\hzero$ and $\hone$ are dual.

\todo[inline]{using repartitions, it may be better to say that the restriction to U1 is like taking a repartition equal to f everywhere except P0, where we just pick some non-zero value}

We now compute a basis of $H^1(X,\cO_X)$, and then state a basis of $\derhamhone$ in the following theorem.\todo{come back to this and make notes}
\begin{lem}\label{basish1}
 Via the isomorphism \todo{reference 1} the residue classes of $\frac{y}{x}, \ldots , \frac{y}{x^g} \in K(X)$, restricted to $U_1$\todo{should this be $U_1 \cap U_2$}, form a basis of $H^1(X,\cO_X)$.
\end{lem}
\begin{proof}
\todo[inline]{show functions are  regular on intersection}
We use Serre duality and the fact that if $p\neq 2$ the elements $\omega_i = x^iy^{-1}dx$, where $i \in \{0,\ldots, g-1\}$, form a basis of $\hzero$.
Then for $j\in \{1, \ldots, g\}$  we consider $\langle x^iy^{-1}dx, yx^{-j}|_{U_1}\rangle$\todo{translate in to adeles}, which is equal to the residue of $x^{i-j}dx|_{U_1}$.\todo{explain this sentence, in particular the equality}
In general, the divisor of $x^{i-j}dx$ (when not restricted to $U_1$) when $p\neq 2$ is
\begin{equation}\label{residuedivisor}
\begin{split}
\di(x^{i-j}dx) & = R - 2D_\infty +(i-j)D_0 - (i-j)D_\infty \\
& = R + (i-j)D_0 - (i-j+2)D_\infty.
\end{split}
\end{equation}
\todo{cite 9 and recall formula for div x}Now if $\infty$ is a branch point, then we see that $x^{i-j}dx$ has a pole of order one at $P_\infty$ if and only if $i-j = -1$ (recall that in this case the ramification divisor has a $[P_\infty]$ term with coefficient one).
Since there are no other poles on $U_1$ the residue is necessarily non-zero and hence the elements $yx^{-j}$ form a basis for $j= i+1$ (i.e. $j \in \{1, \ldots, g\}$).\todo{more details, clearer etc}

\todo[inline]{let $\alpha:X \ra Y$ be an isom of curves, $\omega$ a diff on $Y$ and $P\in X$. Then $\res_{\alpha(P)}(\omega) = \res_P(\pi^*\omega)$. Let $\alpha$ be the hyperelliptic involution, and we see that $Res_{P_\infty} (\omega ) = \res_{P_\infty'}(\omega)$.}
On the other hand, if $\infty$ is not a branch point we have two poles of order one, $P_\infty$ and $P_\infty'$.
Since we have two poles we need to check that the residues at these poles do not cancel to zero.
This is equivalent to checking that the residue is non-zero at the points in $X\backslash U_1$ (of which there are at most two --- $P_0$ and $P_0'$).
If $0$ is a branch point then we have a pole at $P_0$ of order one when $i-j=-1$, and hence a non-zero residue, and we are done.
On the other hand if $0$ is not a branch point then when $i-j=-1$ we have a pole at both of these, so we need to check that the residues do not cancel.
Fortunately, they are largely symmetric.
We note that $t=y-\sqrt{f(0)}$ and $s=y+\sqrt{f(0)}$ are uniformising parameters at $P_0$ and $P_0'$ respectively.
We also note that since
\[
2ydy = dy^2 = df = f'dx
\]
then
\[
dy=\frac{f'}{2y}dx.
\]
We then rewrite the expansion of $\frac{1}{x}dx$ (i.e. $x^{i-j}dx$ when $i-j=-1$) as follows
\begin{align*}
\frac{1}{x}dx & = \sum_{i\geq -1}c_it^i dt \\
& = \sum_{i\geq -1}c_it^i d\left(y-\sqrt{f(0)}\right)\\
& = \sum_{i\geq -1}c_it^i dy \\
& = \sum_{i\geq -1}c_it^i \frac{f'}{2y}dx,
\end{align*}
where $c_i \in k$.
Now that both sides are in terms of the same differential we can match coefficients to discover the value of $c_{-1}$.
We remark that at this point the exact same computations yield
\[
\frac{1}{x}dx = \sum_{i\geq -1}d_is^i \frac{f'}{2y}dx.
\]
Now $\frac{1}{x}$ has a pole at $P_0$ and the coefficient of $dx$ on the right hand side that can also have a pole at $P_0$ is 
\[
c_{-1}t^{-1}\frac{f'}{2y} = \frac{c_{-1}f'}{2y^2 - 2y\sqrt{(f(0)}} = \frac{c_{-1}f'\left( 2f+2y\sqrt{f(0)}\right) }{4(f^2-f\cdot f(0))}.
\]
We will use the fact that this is the only part of the sum that can contain a term of the form $\frac{1}{x}$ to compute the residue.
Clearly no part of $\frac{2c_{-1}f'y\sqrt{f(0)}}{4(f^2-f\cdot f(0))}$ can contain a $\frac{1}{x}$ term, since there is no way of removing the $y$.
This means we just need to compute the $\frac{1}{x}$ terms in $\frac{c_{-1}f'\cdot f}{2(f^2-f\cdot f(0))}$ and compare coefficients to show the residue is non-zero on $X \backslash U_1$.

We notice at this point that by almost the same calculations when expanding about $P_0'$ we get the following
\[
d_{-1}s^{-1}\frac{f'}{2y} = \frac{d_{-1}f'\left(2f-2y\sqrt{f(0)}\right) }{4(f^2 - f\cdot f(0))}.
\]
Using the same argument as before we dispense of the $y$ term, and hence $d_{-1}$ is determined uniquely by the $\frac{1}{x}$ terms in $\frac{2d_{-1}f' \cdot f}{4(f^2-f\cdot f(0))}$.
Since $c_{-1}$ and $d_{-1}$ are determined in the same way, they must take the same value. 
Since the characteristic is not 2, and since $c_{-1} \neq 0$, we conclude that $\res_{X\backslash U_2}(x^{-1}dx) = 2c_{-1} \neq 0$.
This completes the proof when $p \neq 2$.
\todo[inline]{Maybe I could just use $x$ as a UP at 0, and simplify the whole thing to a few lines}

\todo[inline]{section missing}
We now suppose that $p=2$.
Again, if $i-j=-1$ and $\infty$ is branch point then we again have a pole of order one at $P_\infty$, and hence a non-zero residue there.
Also, even if $\infty$ is not a branch point it still suffices to compute the residue on $X\backslash U_2$, and we see that if $0$ is a branch point this is non-zero.
So we again need only consider the case when both $\infty$ and $0$ are not branch points.

We start by noticing that if we let $P_0 = (0,a)$ and $P_0' = (0,a+H(0))$ then we know that $s=y-a$ and $t=y-(a+H(0))$ are uniformising parameters at $P_0$ and $P_0'$ respectively.
So to work out the residue of $\frac{1}{x}dx$ at $P_0$ we wish to find the $c_{-1}$ coefficient in the expansion
\begin{align*}
\frac{1}{x}dx & = \sum_{i \geq -1} c_i s^i d(y-a) \\
& = \sum_{i\geq -1} c_i s^i dy \\
& = \sum_{i \geq -1} c_i s^i \left(\frac{F' - yH'}{H} \right) dx,
\end{align*}
where the last line follows from \eqref{divdyp=2} and $c_i \in k$.
Now $\left(\frac{F' -yH'}{H}\right)$ cannot have a pole at $0$ since $H(0) \neq 0$, so the only part of the series which can contain a $\frac{1}{x}$ term is the $i=-1$ term.
We will use this and compare the coefficients to work out the residue at the points. \todo{come back and describe what I actually do when I have done it}

In other words we wish to find the $\frac{1}{x}$ term in 
\[
c_{-1}s^{-1}\left(\frac{F' - yH'}{H} \right) = \frac{c_{-1}}{y-a} \left( \frac{F' - yH'}{H} \right).
\]
We would like to remove the $y$ term from the denominator of this.
After noticing that 
\[
(y-a)(y-(H+a)) = y^2 - yH - a(H-a) = F- a(H-a)
\]
we clearly see that 
\begin{align*}
\frac{c_{-1}}{y-a} \left( \frac{F' - yH'}{H} \right) & = c_{-1} \left( \frac{(F'-yH')(y-(H+a))}{H(F-a(H+a))} \right) \\
& = c_{-1} \left( \frac{F'y - F'(H+a) - (F -yH)H' - yH'(H-a)}{H(F-a(H+a))} \right) \\
& = \frac{c_{-1}(F'(H+a) - FH')}{H(F-a(H+a))} + \frac{c_{-1}y(F' - aH')}{H(F-a(H+a))},
\end{align*}
where we have collected together the $y$ terms, since clearly they cannot contain a $\frac{1}{x}$ term.

We then perform a similar operation on the equivalent term for the expansion around $P_0'$, which is
\[
\frac{d_{-1}(F' - yH')}{H(y - (H(0) - a))}.
\]
As before, we remove the $y$ term from the denominator, this time using the identity
\begin{align*}
(y-(H(0)+a))(y - (H+H(0)+a)) &  = y^2 - yH - (H(0) - a)(H - H(0) - a) \\
& = F - (H(0)-a)(H - H(0) - a).
\end{align*}
From this we can then derive. 
\begin{align*}
d_{-1}t^{-1} \left( \frac{F' - yH'}{H} \right)  = & d_{-1}\left( \frac{(F'  - yH')(y+ H + H(0) + a)}{H(F -(H(0)-a)(H - H(0) -a ))} \right) \\
 =&  \frac{d_{-1}(HF' + F'H(0) + aF' - FH')}{H(F-(H(0) - a)(H - H(0) - a))}  \\
& - \frac{d_{-1}y(F' - H'H(0) - aH')}{H(F - (H(0) - a)( H - H(0) - a))}.
\end{align*}



{\sl Problem - can't complete the square. The problem would be if the $c_{-1}$ and $d_{-1}$ in 
\[
c_{-1}\frac{1}{y-a}\left(\frac{F'+yH'}{H}\right) \text{ and } d_{-1}\frac{1}{y-a-H(0)}\left(\frac{F'+yH'}{H}\right)
\]
were equal, where $a$ is one of the points above $0\in \mathbb P_k^1$.

Ideas - Try equating the two (they should both be equal to $\frac{1}{x}$).
Make sure there is no way of writing as a square to get rid of $y$.

Hunch - if one of the residues is $a$ the other is likely $a+1$.}
\end{proof}



In order to state a basis of $\derhamhone$, as well as to shorten the proof of the following theorem, we define the following polynomials. 
We suppose that $1 \leq i \leq g$.
Then when $p\neq 2$ we define
\[
s_i(x) := f'(x) - \frac{2if(x)}{x} \in k[x]
\]
\todo{just realised this may have a $\frac{1}{x}$ term - note for future}and when $p = 2$ we define
\begin{equation}\label{capitals}
S_i(x,y) := xF'(x) + xyH'(x) + iyH(x)\in k[x]\oplus yk[x] \subseteq k(x,y).
\end{equation}

We now decompose these polynomials into two parts, which will be used in the sequel.
Firstly, we write $s_i(x)$ as $s_i(x) = \phi_i(x) + \psi_i(x)$, where $\psi_i(x), \phi_i(x) \in k[x]$ are the unique polynomials such that the degree of $\psi_i (x)$ is at most $g$ and $x^{g+1}$ divides $\phi_i(x)$.


Secondly, we write $S_i(x,y)$ as $S_i(x,y) = \Phi_i(x,y) + \Psi_i(x,y)$, where $\Phi_i(x,y), \Psi_i(x,y) \in k[x,y]$ are the unique polynomials such that the degree of $\Psi_i(x,y)$ has degree less than $i$ as a polynomial in $x$, and $\Phi_i(x,y)$ is divisible by $x^i$.\todo{change paragraph, in particular "as a polynomial in x" part}

Viewing $\derhamhone$ as a quotient of \eqref{derhamconditions}, we now give a $k$-vector space basis of $\derhamhone$.
\begin{thm}\label{basis}

If $p \neq 2$ then the residue classes of the elements 
\begin{equation}\label{one}
 \left( \left( \frac{\psi_i(x)}{2yx^i}\right) dx, \left(\frac{-\phi_i(x)}{2yx^i}\right) dx, x^{-i}y\right), i=1, \ldots ,g,
\end{equation}
along with the residue classes of 
\begin{equation}\label{two}
 \left( \frac{x^{i}}{y} dx , \frac{x^{i}}{y} dx, 0 \right), i = 0,\ldots ,g-1,
\end{equation}
form a basis of $\derhamhone$.

On the other hand, if $p=2$ then the residue classes of the elements 
\begin{equation}\label{three}
\left( \left(\frac{\Psi_i(x,y)}{x^{i+1}H(x)}\right) dx, \left( \frac{\Phi_i(x,y)}{x^{i+1}H(x)} \right) dx, x^{-i}y \right), i =1, \ldots , g,
\end{equation}
together with the residue classes of 
\begin{equation}\label{four}
\left( \frac{x^{i}}{H(x)} dx, \frac{x^{i}}{H(x)} dx, 0 \right), i=0, \ldots, g-1,
\end{equation}
form a basis of $\derhamhone$.
\end{thm}

Before proving this theorem we use it to prove the following corollary.
\todo[inline]{check proof and proposition in general}

\begin{cor}
The action of $G$ on $\derhamhone$ is faithful unless $G$ contains a hyperelliptic involution and $p=2$.
\end{cor}

\begin{proof}
Recall that $H^0(X,\Omega_X)$ injects into $\derhamhone$.
Then if $p \neq 2$ or $G$ does not contain a hyperelliptic involution, it follows from the main theorem of \cite{faithfulaction} that $G$ acts faithfully on $H^0(X,\Omega_X)$, and hence $G$ acts faithfully on $\derhamhone$.\todo{use internal reference in thesis}

We now suppose that $p=2$ and that $G$ contains a hyperelliptic involution, which we denote by $\sigma$.
By the same theorem from \cite{faithfulaction}\todo{reference thesis} as used in the last paragraph, we know that $\sigma$ acts trivially on $\hzero$.
Since $\hzero$ is dual to $\hone$ we know that $G$ also does not act faithfully on $\hone$.

We can see exactly why this is from the view of \cech cohomology, and this will also help to determine the action on $\derhamhone$.
If we fix a natural number $i$ then $\frac{y}{x^i}$, considered as an element of $\cO_X(U_1\cap U_2)$, is mapped to $\frac{y}{x^i} + \frac{H(x)}{x^i}$. 
Now we can split $\frac{H(x)}{x^i}$ as follows, 
\begin{equation*}
\frac{H(x)}{x^i} =  \frac{b_{i-1}x^{i-1} + \ldots + b_1x}{x^i} - \left( - \frac{x^d + b_{d-1}x^{d-1} + \ldots + b_ix^i}{x^i} \right),
\end{equation*}
and since this is clearly the difference of an element of $\cO_X(U_1)$ and an element of $\cO_X(U_2)$ we see that $\frac{H(x)}{x^i}$ is zero in $\hone$.
\todo[inline]{look at alternative proof}
We let 
\[
{}_iH_1(x) = \frac{b_{i-1}x^{i-1} + \ldots + b_1x}{x^i}
\]
and 
\[
{}_iH_2(x) = - \frac{x^d + b_{d-1}x^{d-1} + \ldots + b_ix^i}{x^i}.
\]
\todo{this can be made shorter/ rearranged - kept for now as may be useful}

We can now describe exactly how sigma acts on the elements of \eqref{three} using ${}_iH_1(x)$ and ${}_iH_2(x)$:
\begin{multline}
\sigma \left( \left( \left(\frac{-\Psi_i(x,y)}{x^{i+1}H(x)}\right) dx, \left( \frac{\Phi_i(x,y)}{x^{i+1}H(x)} \right) dx, x^{-i}y \right)\right) = \\
 \left( \left(\frac{-\Psi_i(x,y)}{x^{i+1}H(x)} \right) dx + {}_iH'_1(x)dx,  \left( \frac{\Phi_i(x,y)}{x^{i+1}H(x)} \right) dx+ {}_iH'_2(x)dx, x^{-i}(y+H(x)) \right).
\end{multline}
So the action on the basis elements in \eqref{three} is equivalent to adding 
\[
\left( {}_iH_1'dx, {}_iH_2'dx, x^{-i}H(x) \right),
\]
which clearly satisfies the conditions of \eqref{quotient} and hence is zero.
So the action of the involution $\sigma$ on $\derhamhone$ is trivial and hence the action of the group $G$ is not faithful.
\begin{comment}
Hence the action is trivial if and only if ${}_iH_1'(x)dx = {}_iH_2'(x)dx =0$.
This cannot happen though, since we can always find an $l\in \{0,1\}$ such that $l \not\equiv d\ \text{mod}\ 2$, and then $d\left({}_iH_2(x)\right) = {}_iH_2'(x)dx \neq 0$, as we can see from the leading term (unless of course $d$ is zero, in which case $d\left({}_iH_1(x)\right) \neq 0$).
\end{comment}
\end{proof}


We now prove Theorem \ref{basis}.

\begin{proof}
We make use of the fact that the short exact sequence \eqref{ses} splits as a sequence of vector spaces over $k$, and that we know bases of the outer two terms.

It is clear that \eqref{two} and \eqref{four} are elements of \eqref{derhamconditions}, and it follows from \cite[Thm 6.1]{faithfulaction} that they are the image of the basis of $H^0(X,\Omega_X)$ in $\derhamhone$.\todo{swap the order of these statements?}

Moreover, it is obvious that if the elements \eqref{one} and \eqref{three} are in \eqref{derhamconditions} then they will map to the basis of $\hone$ given in Lemma \ref{basish1}.
So we need only show that the first two terms in \eqref{one} and \eqref{three} do indeed belong to \eqref{derhamconditions}.\todo{change wording}
For the rest of the tproof we fix $i \in \{1, \ldots ,g\}$.


We start with the case $p\neq 2$, and observe that
\begin{align*}
\left(  \frac{\psi_i(x)}{2yx^i}  - \frac{-\phi_i(x)}{2yx^i} \right) dx & =  \frac{s_i(x)}{2yx^i} dx \\
& =  \frac{1}{2yx^i} \left( f' - \frac{2if}{x} \right) dx \\
& =  \frac{x^i}{2y} \left( \frac{f'}{x^{2i}}dx -\frac{2if}{x^{2i+1}} dx \right) \\
& =  \frac{x^i}{2y} \left( fd\left(\frac{1}{x^{2i}}\right) + \frac{1}{x^{2i}}df \right) \\
& =  \frac{x^i}{2y}d(fx^{-2i}) \\
& =  \frac{x^i}{2y} d\left(\left(yx^{-i}\right)^2\right) \\
& =  d(yx^{-i}),
\end{align*}
with the penultimate line following from the defining equation \eqref{definingequationpnot2}.
This shows that the elements \eqref{one} satisfy one of the conditions to be in \eqref{derhamconditions}.\todo{change wording}
Now it remains to show that $\frac{\phi_i}{2yx^i}dx$ and $\frac{-\psi_i}{2yx^i}dx$ are regular on $U_2$ and $U_1$ respectively.
\todo[inline]{recall that y/xi is reg on U! intersect U2??}


In order to do this we define $\alpha^i_j \in k$ for $0\leq j \leq 2g+1$ by the equation\todo{change superscript to something else?}
\[
s_i(x) = \alpha^i_{2g+1}x^{2g+1} + \ldots + \alpha^i_0,
\]
so that
\[
\phi_i(x) = \alpha^i_{2g+1}x^{2g+1} + \ldots + \alpha^i_{g+1}x^{g+1} \ {\rm and } \ \psi_i(x) = \alpha^i_gx^g + \ldots + \alpha^i_0.
\]
Note that it is possible for any of $\alpha^i_j$ to be zero. Indeed, it is possible for either $\phi_i(x)$ or $\psi_i(x)$ to be zero.
Whenever they are non-zero we denote their degrees as polynomials in $x$ by $d_\phi$ and $d_\psi$ respectively. From the definition of $\phi_i(x)$ and $\psi_i(x)$ we know that $0 < d_\psi \leq g+1$ and $g < d_\phi \leq 2g+1$ for all $1 \leq i \leq g$.
\todo{remove d psi? - will keep for now in case useful later}


We now show that $\frac{-\phi_i}{2yx^i}dx$ and $\frac{\psi_i}{2yx^i}dx$ are regular on $U_2$ and $U_1$ respectively.
We may assume that $\phi_i$ and $\psi_i$ are non-zero, since zero is regular everywhere.
The divisor of $\frac{-\phi_i}{2yx^i}dx$ is

\begin{align*}
\di\left( \frac{-\phi_i}{2yx^i}dx \right) & =  \di(\phi_i) -\di(y) - \di(x^i) + \di (dx) \\
& =  \di(\phi_i) - ( R - (g+1)D_\infty) - (iD_0 - iD_\infty) + (R - 2D_\infty) \\
& =  \left( \di_0\left( \frac{\phi_i}{x^{g+1}}\right) + (g+1)D_0 - d_\phi D_\infty\right) - iD_0 + (g+i-1)D_\infty \\
& \geq  \di_0\left( \frac{\phi_i}{x^{g+1}}\right) + (g+1)D_0 - (2g+1)D_\infty - iD_0 + (g+i-1)D_\infty \\
& =  \di_0\left( \frac{\phi_i}{x^{g+1}} \right) + (i-g-2)D_\infty + (g-i+1)D_0,
\end{align*}
where the second equality makes use of \eqref{pnot2divisors}.
Since $i \leq g$ the differential $\frac{-\phi_i}{2yx^i}dx$ is regular on $U_2 = X\backslash \pi^{-1}(\infty)$.

Similarly the divisor of $\frac{\psi_i}{2yx^i}dx$ is

\begin{align*}
\di \left( \frac{\psi_i}{2yx^i}dx\right) & =  \di(\psi_i) - \di(y) - \di(x^i) + \di (dx) \\
& =  \di (\psi_i ) -(R - (g+1)D_\infty) - (iD_0 - iD_\infty) + (R -2D_\infty) \\
& =  \di(\psi_i) + (g+i-1)D_\infty -iD_0 \\
& =  (\di_0(\psi_i) -d_\psi D_\infty) + (g+i-1)D_\infty -iD_0 \\
& \geq \left( \di_0(\psi_i) - gD_\infty \right) + (g+i-1)D_\infty -iD_0 \\
& =  \di_0(\psi_i) + (i-1)D_\infty - iD_0.
\end{align*}
Again, the second equality uses \eqref{pnot2divisors}, and since $i\geq 1$ we conclude that $\frac{\psi_i(x)}{2yx^i}dx$ is regular on $U_1 = X \backslash \pi^{-1}(0)$, completing the $p\neq 2$ case.


We now suppose that $p=2$.\todo{remind that signs don't matter?}
We see that
\begin{align*}
\left( \left( \frac{ \Psi_i}{x^{i+1}H} \right) - \left( \frac{\Phi_i}{x^{i+1}H} \right) \right) dx & =  \frac{S_i}{x^{i+1}H}dx \\
& =  \left( \frac{F'}{x^iH} + \frac{yH'}{x^iH} + \frac{iy}{x^{i+1}} \right) dx \\
& =  \frac{1}{x^i}\left( \frac{F' + yH'}{H} \right) dx + \frac{iy}{x^{i+1}}dx \\
& =  x^{-i}dy + yd \left( x^{-i}\right) \\
& =  d\left( yx^{-i}\right),
\end{align*}
\todo{refer to 15}and so, as in the case $p \neq 2$, it only remains to show that for each $i\in {1, \ldots, g}$ the differentials $\frac{\Phi_i}{x^{i+1}H}dx$ and $\frac{\Psi_i}{x^{i+1}H}dx$ are regular on $U_2$ and $U_1$ respectively.\todo{consider wording}


We define $A^i_{j+1} \in k$ for $0 \leq j \leq 2g+2$, and $B_k^i \in k$\todo{maybe don't use superscript} for $1\leq k \leq g+1$ by the equation
\[
S_i(x,y) = A_{2g+2}^ix^{2g+2} + \ldots + A^i_1 x + y(B_{g+1}^i x^{g+1} + \ldots + B_1^i x + B_0^i).
\]
Note that many of these coefficients may be zero.
In particular we note that $B_i^i = 0$ for all $i$.\todo{colon?}
If $i$ is even then $B_{g+1}^ix^{g+1} + \ldots + B_1^ix + B_0^i = H'x$ and so the coefficient of $x^i$ in $H'x$ is $ib_i = 0$ (recall that we defined $b_i$ to be the coefficients of $H$ in \eqref{hcoefficients}).
Similarly, if $i$ is odd then $B_{g+1}^ix^{g+1} + \ldots + B_1^ix + B_0^i = H'x + H$, and then the coefficient of $x^i$ is $ib_i+ ib_i = 2ib_i = 0$.\todo{make one sentence}


We can now define the following polynomials:
\begin{equation}\label{Split}
\begin{split}
\Phi_i^x(x) & =  A^i_{2g+2}x^{2g+2} + \ldots + A^i_{i+1}x^{i+1} \\
\Psi_i^x(x) & =  A^i_ix^i + \ldots + A^i_1x \\
\Phi_i^y(x) & =  B_g^ix^g + \ldots B_{i+1}^ix^{i+1} \\
\Psi_i^y(x) & =  B_{i-1}^ix^{i-1} + \ldots + B_1^ix + B_0^i.
\end{split}
\end{equation}
We denote the degrees of these polynomials by $d_{\Phi}^x, d_{\Psi}^x, d_{\Phi}^y$ and $d_{\Psi}^y$ respectively.

Clearly $\Phi_i(x,y) = \Phi_i^x(x) + y\Phi_i^y(x)$ and $\Psi_i (x,y)= \Psi_i^x(x) + y\Psi_i^y(x)$, and we will use these splittings to show that $\frac{ \Phi_i(x) dx}{x^{i+1}H}$ and $\frac{\Psi_i(x) dx}{x^{i+1}H}$ are regular on $U_2$ and $U_1$ respectively.

We start by computing the divisor of $\frac{dx}{x^{i+1}H}$, since it is a common component to all the differentials we need to look at.
This yields
\begin{align}
\di \left( \frac{dx}{x^{i+1}H} \right) & = \di(dx) - \di (x^{i+1}) - \di (H) \nonumber \\
& = (R-2D_\infty) - ((i+1)D_0 - (i+1)D_\infty) - (R - (g+1)D_\infty) \nonumber \\
& = (g+i)D_\infty - (i+1)D_0,
\end{align}
using \eqref{divdxp=2}, \eqref{divhp=2} and \eqref{divxp=2}.
We now use this, along with \eqref{divyp=2} and the polynomials we defined in the preceding paragraphs, to complete the proof.

We begin by computing the divisors associated to $\Phi_i$.
Firstly,
\begin{align*}
\di \left( \frac{\Phi_i^x dx}{x^{i+1} H} \right)  = &  \di(\Phi_i^x) -(i+1)D_0 + (g+i)D_\infty\\
 = & \left( \di_0(\Phi_i^x) -d_\Phi^xD_\infty\right) -(i+1)D_0 + (g+i)D_\infty\\
 \geq & \di_0(\Phi_i^x) - (2g+2)D_\infty - (i+1)D_0 + (g+i)D_\infty \\
 = &  \di_0(\Phi_i^x) - (i+1)D_0 + (i-2-g)D_\infty \\
 =  & \di_0 \left( \frac{\Phi_i^x}{x^{i+1}} \right) + (i-g-2)D_\infty,
\end{align*}
From this we see that the differential $\frac{\phi_i^xdx}{x^{i+1}H}$ is clearly regular on $U_2 = X \backslash \pi^{-1}(\infty)$.\todo{consider consistency of putting differential in frac or not}

We now compute the divisor of the other half of $\frac{\Phi_i}{x^{i+1}H}dx$, namely
\begin{align*}
\di\left(\frac{y\Phi_i^y dx}{x^{i+1}H} \right)  = & \di(y) + \di(\Phi_i^y) -(i+1)D_0 + (g+i)D_\infty\\
 = & \di(y) + \di_0(\Phi_i^y) - d_\Phi^yD_\infty -(i+1)D_0 + (g+i)D_\infty \\
 \geq & \di(y) + \di_0(\Phi_i^y) - (g+1)D_\infty - (i+1)D_0 + (g+i)D_\infty \\
 = & \di(y) + \di_0\left(\frac{\Phi_i^y}{x^{i+1}} \right) + (i-1)D_\infty.
\end{align*}
\todo{refer to 14}Since $y$ only has poles at points in $\pi^{-1}(\infty)$, this completes the proof that $\frac{\Phi_i dx}{x^{i+1}H}$ is regular on $U_2 = X \backslash \pi^{-1}(\infty)$.

Now we complete the same computations on $\Psi_i$, starting with $\Psi_i^x$:
\begin{align*}
\di\left( \frac{\Psi_i^x dx}{x^{i+1}H} \right)  = &  \\di(\Psi_i^x)  - (i+1)D_0 + (g+i)D_\infty \\
& = (di_0(\Psi_i^x) -d_\psi^xD_\infty) - (i+1)D_0 + (g+i)D_\infty \\
 \geq &  \di_0(\Psi_i^x ) - iD_\infty - (i+1)D_0 + (g+i)D_\infty \\
 = &  \di_0(\Psi_i^x) - (i+1)D_0 + gD_\infty,
\end{align*}
and it is clear that the divisor is positive on $U_1 = X \backslash \pi^{-1}(0)$.

For the other half of the differential we need to consider seperate cases.
If we assume that $\infty$ is branch point then we see that\todo{refer to 14}
\begin{align*}
\di\left(\frac{y\Psi_i^y dx}{x^{i+1}H} \right)  =  & \di_0(y) - (2g+1)[P_\infty] + \di(\Psi_i^y) - (i+1)D_0 + (g+i)[P_\infty] \\
 =  & \di_0(y) + \di(\Psi_i^y) -(i+1)D_0 + (2i -1)[P_\infty] \\
 = &  \di_0(y) + \di_0(\Psi_i^y) - d_\Psi^y[P_\infty] - (i+1)D_0 + (2i-1)[P_\infty] \\
 \geq &  \di_0(y) + \di_0(\Psi_i^y) -(i-1)[P_\infty] -(i+1)D_0 + (2i-1)[P_\infty] \\
 =   &\di_0(y) + \di_0(\Psi_i^y) -(i+1)D_0 + [P_\infty],
\end{align*}
which is clearly positive on $U_1$.
On the other hand, if $\infty$ is not a branch point then we have
\begin{align*}
\di\left(\frac{y\Psi_i^y dx}{x^{i+1}H} \right)  =  & \di(y) + \di(\Psi_i^y) - (i+1)D_0 + (g+i)D_\infty \\
= & \di(y) + \di_0(\Psi_i^y) - (i+1)D_0 + (g+i - d_\Psi^y)D_\infty \\
\geq & \di(y) + \di_0(\Psi_i^y) - (i+1)D_0 + (g+1)D_\infty. \\
\end{align*}
Since we know from \eqref{divyp=2} that $y$ cannot have a pole of order greater $g+1$ at $P_\infty$ or $P_\infty'$, and only has poles at these points, it follows that the differential $\frac{y\psi_i^y dx}{x^{i+1}H}$ is regular on $U_1 = X \backslash \pi^{-1}(0)$.
Thus we have completed the proof.


\end{proof}

\section{Computing the residue}

Introduction needs to be finalised once the proof in the previous section is completed.
In particular, if the exact residue can be computed then we may as well do so.
Currently we are assuming in this section that $\infty$ and 0 are a branch point.

\todo[inline]{emphasise/mention that the basis is dual}
\begin{lem}
Suppose that $\infty\in \mathbb P_k^1$ is a branch point of $\pi$.
If $p \neq 2$ then ${\rm res}_{P_\infty}(\frac{1}{x}dx) = -2$.
If $p=2$ then ${\rm res}_{P_\infty}\left(\frac{ydx}{xH(x)}\right) = 1$.
\end{lem}

\begin{proof}

We first consider the case $p\neq 2$.
We note that $t:= \frac{y}{x^{g+1}}$ is a uniformising parameter at $P_\infty$ as can be seen by computing the order of $t$ at $P_\infty$ as follows
\begin{align}
\ord_{P_\infty}(t) & =  \frac{1}{2}\ord_{P_\infty}(t^2) \\
  & =  \frac{1}{2}\ord_{P_\infty}\left( \frac{f}{x^{2g+2}} \right) \\
& =  \frac{1}{2}\ord_{P_\infty}(f(x)) - \frac{1}{2}\ord_{P_\infty}(x^{2g+2})\\
& =  -(2g+1) + (2g+2) \\
& =  1.
\end{align}

We now write $\frac{1}{x}dx$ in terms of $dt$.
By the quotient rule we know that
\begin{align*}
dt^2 & =  d \left( \frac{f}{x^{2g+2}} \right) \\
& =  \frac{x^{2g+2}f' + x^{2g+1}f}{x^{4g+4}} dx \\
& =  \frac{1}{x^{2g+2}} \left( f' + \frac{f}{x} \right) dx
\end{align*}
\todo{check the above computation - missed coefficient of x2g+1}from which we conclude that
\[
\frac{1}{x}dx = \frac{2tx^{2g+1}}{\left(\frac{f' - (2g+2)f}{x} \right)} dt.
\]


We now let $p(x) = \left(\frac{(2g+2)f(x)}{x} - f'(x)\right)$, and noting that the coefficient of $x^{2g}$ in $p(x)$ is $(2g+2)a_{2g+1} - (2g+1)a_{2g+1} = a_{2g+1}$, we see that $h(x)$ is a degree $2g$ polynomial in $x$.
We wish to compute the coefficient of $t^{-1}$ in the expansion of $\frac{1}{x}dx$ at $P_\infty$ and for this we require the following expansions
\begin{align}
\frac{p(x)}{x^{2g+1}} = \frac{a_{2g+1}x^{2g}}{x^{2g+1}} + \ldots = \frac{a_{2g+1}}{x} + \ldots \qquad \text{and} \qquad t^2 = \frac{f}{x^{2g+2} } = \frac{a_{2g+1}}{x} + \ldots
\end{align}

Since $\ord_{P_\infty}\left(\frac{p(x)}{x^{2g+1}}\right) = 2$ we know that $\frac{p(x)}{x^{2g+1}} = \sum_{j\geq 2} c_j t^j$ for some $c_j\in k$, and from the above computations we can see that $c_2 = 1$.
We also know that $\frac{x^{2g+1}}{p(x)} = \sum_{k\geq -2} d_kt^k$, for some $d_k\in k$, and clearly $d_{-2} = 1$.
Now
\[
\frac{1}{x}dx = \left( -2t \cdot \sum_{i\geq -2} d_it^i\right) dt 
\]
so we see that $\res_{P_\infty}\left( \frac{1}{x} dx\right) = 2$.
This completes the proof of the lemma when $p\neq 2$.

We now turn to the case when $p=2$.
We now wish to compute the residue of $\frac{ydx}{xH(x)}$ at $P_\infty$.
We start by noting that $t = \frac{y}{x^{g+1}}$ is a uniformising parameter at $P_\infty$ which we check by computing the divisor:
\begin{align*}
\di(t) & = \di_0(y) - (2g+1)[P_\infty] -(g+1)D_0 + (g+1)D_\infty \\
& = \di_0(y)-(g+1)D_0 + [P_\infty],
\end{align*}
using \eqref{divxp=2} and \eqref{divyp=2}.
So clearly $t$ is a uniformising parameter at $P_\infty$.

We now wish to write $\frac{y}{xH(x)}dx$ as $r(x,y)dt$ for some $r \in k(x,y)$.
We first write $dy$ in terms of $dx$.
Since
\begin{align*}
0 & =  dy^2 \\
& =  d(F+yH) \\
& =  F'dx + Hdy + yH'dx
\end{align*}
we conclude that
\[
dy = \left( \frac{F'+yH'}{H} \right) dx.
\]

We also rewrite $dt$ as follows:
\begin{align*}
dt & =  d\left( \frac{y}{x^{g+1}} \right) \\
& =  yd\frac{1}{x^{g+1}} + \frac{1}{x^{g+1}}dy \\
& =  \frac{1}{x^{g+1}} \left( \frac{(g+1)y}{x} + \frac{F'+yH'}{H} \right) dx \\
& =  \frac{1}{x^{g+1}} \left( \frac{xF'}{y} + xH' + (g+1)H \right) \frac{y}{Hx} dx.
\end{align*}

In total we then have
\[
\frac{y}{xH(x)}dx = \frac{x^{g+1}y}{S_{g+1}(x,y)}dt
\]
where $S_{g+1}(x,y)$ is as defined in \eqref{capitals}.

We know\todo{citation} that $\frac{x^{g+1}y}{S_{g+1}(x,y)} = \sum_{i\geq -1} c_i t^i$, with $c_i \in k$, and we wish to compute $c_{-1}$.
We shall do this by computing the coefficient $d_1$ of $t$ in the expansion $\frac{S_{g+1}(x,y)}{x^{g+1}y} = \sum_{i\geq 1}d_it^i$.
We can split up $\frac{S_{g+1}(x,y)}{x^{g+1}y}$ into three terms, namely $\frac{xF'}{x^{g+1}y}$, $\frac{yxH'}{x^{g+1}y}$ and $\frac{yH}{x^{g+1}y}$.\todo{missing factor of $g+1$}
Each of these terms can of course be written as a power series in $t$, but only the first term mentioned has order 1 at $P_\infty$\todo{explain this}, and hence this term will uniquely determine $d_1$.
Suppose that $F = \alpha_{2g+1}x^{2g+1} + \alpha_{2g}x^{2g} + \ldots + \alpha_1x^1 + \alpha_0$.
Then $xF'= \alpha_{2g+1}x^{2g+1} + \alpha_{2g-1}x^{2g-1} + \ldots + \alpha_1x^1$; i.e. the terms with an even power are removed.

So the only term in $\frac{xF'}{x^{g+1}y}$ of order 1 at $P_\infty$ is $\frac{\alpha_{2g+1}x^{2g+1}}{x^{g+1}y} = \frac{\alpha_{2g+1}x^{g}}{y}$.
Since
\[
\frac{\alpha_{2g+1}x^g}{y} = \frac{\alpha_{2g+1}}{x}t^{-1}
\]
and $\frac{1}{x} = \sum_{i\geq 2}e_it^i$ for some $e_i \in k$, if we compute $e_2$ then we will have effectively computed $d_1$.
Now $t^2 = \frac{F }{x^{2g+2}}+ \frac{Hy}{x^{2g+2}}$, and clearly $\frac{Hy}{x^{2g+2}}$ has no terms of the form\todo{explain this - also, wording} $\frac{c}{x}$ for some $c \in k$.
On the other hand
\[
\frac{F}{x^{2g+2}} = \frac{\alpha_{2g+1}}{x} + \ldots
\]
Hence we conclude that $e_2 = \frac{1}{\alpha_{2g+1}}$.
It follows that $d_1 = \alpha_{2g+1} \cdot \frac{1}{\alpha_{2g+1}} = 1$.
We finally use this to conclude that $c_{-1} = \frac{1}{d_{1}} = 1$.

\section{Stability of modular curves in characteristic greater than 2}
In this section we consider some modular hyperelliptic curves and how their automorphism groups at on the first de-Rham cohomology group of the curves.
The automorphism groups of these curves can be found in \cite{automorphismshyperellipticmodular}.
We start by considering the curve $X_0(22)$, which can defined by the equation
\begin{equation*}
y^2 = (x^3+ 4x^2 + 8x + 4)(x^3 + 8x^2 + 16x + 16).
\end{equation*}
The automorphism group of this curve is, in general, $\mathbb Z_2 \times \mathbb Z_2$, with the action given by 
\begin{align}
\omega_2\colon (x,y) & \mapsto \left( \frac{4}{x} , \frac{8y}{x^3} \right), \\
\omega_{11}\colon (x,y) & \mapsto (x, -y ).
\end{align}
Note that we are using the notation of \cite{automorphismshyperellipticmodular} for consistency.
We now study how this group action affects the basis of $\derhamhone$.
In particular, we show that the basis associated to $\hone$ in $\derhamhone$ is not stable under the action of the automorphism group.
For each $i \in \{ 1, \ldots , g\}$ we let 
\begin{equation*}
\nu_i = \left( \left( \frac{-\psi_i(x)}{2yx^i} \right) dx , \left( \frac{\phi_i(x)}{2yx^i} \right) dx, x^{-i}y \right).
\end{equation*}
We then note that 
\[
\omega_2(dx) = d( \omega_2(x)) = d\left( \frac{4}{x} \right) = \frac{-4}{x^2}dx.
\]
If we recall that 
\[
s_i(x) = \alpha_{2g+1}^ix^{2g+1} + \ldots + \alpha_0^i
\]
then we can see that the $\omega_2$ acts as follows:
\begin{equation}\label{omega11action}
\begin{split}
\omega_2 (\nu_i) & = \left( -\sum_{j = g+1}^{2g+1} \left( \frac{\alpha_j^i 4^{j-i}x^3}{2x^{j-i}y} \right) \frac{-4}{x^2} dx, \sum_{j = 0}^{g} \left(\frac{\alpha_j^i 4^{j-i} x^3}{2x^{j-i}y} \right) \frac{-4}{x^2}dx , \frac{8yx^i}{4^i x^3} \right) \\
& = \left( \sum_{j=g+1}^{2g+1} \left( \frac{\alpha_j4^{i-j+1}}{2yx^{j-i-1}} \right)dx, \sum_{j = 0}^{g} \left( \frac{-\alpha_j^i 4^{j-i+1}}{2yx^{j-i-1}} \right) dx, \frac{2yx^{i-3}}{4^{i-1}} \right).
\end{split}
\end{equation}

Now it appears that these terms are similar to those of $s_i \left( \frac{4}{x} \right)$, so it would be good to see if we can somehow write $y^2$ in terms of  some function of $\omega_2(x) = \frac{4}{x}$.
We can do this, since of course $\omega_2(y)^2 = \omega_2(y^2) = \omega_2(f(x)) = \omega_2\left( f \left(\frac{4}{x} \right) \right)$.
From this we obtain the identity
\begin{equation*}
y^2 = \frac{x^6 f \left(\frac{4}{x} \right)}{8^2}.
\end{equation*}
From this we obtain
\begin{align*}
dy & = \frac{1}{2y \cdot 8^2} \left( f'\left(\frac{4}{x} \right) x^6 d\left(  \frac{4}{x} \right) + 6 f\left( \frac{4}{x} \right) x^5 dx \right) \\
& = \frac{1}{2y \cdot 8^2} \left( f'\left(\frac{4}{x} \right) \cdot (-4 x^4) + 6 f\left( \frac{4}{x} \right) x^5  \right) dx \\
\end{align*}

We can then use this to compute $d (\omega_2(x^{-i}y)) = d \left( \frac{8yx^{i-3}}{4^i} \right)$, which we now do:
\begin{align*}
d\left( \frac{8yx^{i-3}}{4^i} \right) & = \frac{8}{4^i} \left( x^{i-3}dy + ydx^{i-3} \right) \\
& = \frac{8}{4^i} \left( \frac{x^{i-3}}{2y8^2} \left( \frac{-4}{x^2} \cdot f'\left( \frac{4}{x}  \right) x^6 + 6x^5 f\left( \frac{4}{x} \right) \right) + (i-3)x^{i-4}y \right) dx \\
& = \frac{8}{4^i} \left( \frac{1}{2y8^2} \left(\frac{-4}{x^2} \cdot  f'\left( \frac{4}{x} \right) x^{i+3} + 6x^{i+2} f\left( \frac{4}{x} \right) \right) + \frac{(i-3)x^{i-4}x^6f \left( \frac{4}{x} \right)  }{y8^2} \right) dx \\
& = \frac{8}{4^i} \cdot \frac{x^{i+3}}{2y8^2} \left(\frac{-4}{x^2} \cdot  f' \left( \frac{4}{x} \right)  + \frac{6}{x} f \left( \frac{4}{x} \right)  + \frac{2(i-3)f \left( \frac{4}{x} \right)  }{x} \right) dx \\
& = \frac{x^{i+3}}{2 \cdot 4^i \cdot 8 \cdot y} \left(\frac{-4}{x^2} \cdot  f'\left( \frac{4}{x} \right)  + \frac{ 2i f \left( \frac{4}{x} \right) }{x} \right) dx \\
& = \frac{x^{i+1}}{4^{i+1}y} \left( -f' \left(\frac{4}{x} \right) + \frac{2if \left( \frac{4}{x} \right) x}{4} \right) dx.
\end{align*}
\todo[noline]{Apart from the minus sign in front of $f' \left( \frac{4}{x} \right)$ and a factor of two almost matches up - check computations}Note that the function before $dx$ here is precisely $\omega_2\left(\frac{s_i(x)}{2yx^i} \right)$.

This (almost) shows that
\[
\left( \omega_2 \left( \left( \frac{s_i(x)}{2yx^i} \right) dx \right) , 0, \omega_2( x^{-i}y)\right)
\]
is the zero element in $\derhamhone$.

We will now finally show that the basis of $\hone$ in $\derhamhone$ is not stable under the group action --- in particular, it is not stable under the action of $\omega_2$.
Now we fix $i = g-1$.
We can then clearly see from \eqref{omega11action} that if $\alpha_{g}^i$ is zero all the $x$ terms in the second co-ordinate will have degree at most $g-1$.
\begin{note}
By the action of $\omega_2$ we have $\frac{8^2y^2}{x^6} = f\left(\frac{4}{x} \right)$.
\end{note}

\begin{note}
For $\infty$ is not a branch point the same basis should work. 
Consider $y^2 = f(x)$ where the degree of $f(x)$ is $2g+2$ (i.e. $\infty$ is not ramified), with projection map $\pi : X \rightarrow \mathbb P_k^1$.
Then we can take the cover to be $U_1 := X \backslash \{\pi^{-1}(0)\}$ and $U_2 := X \backslash \{\pi^{-1}(\infty)\}$.
Then we have $\frac{x^idx}{y} \cdot \frac{y}{x^{j}} = x^{i-j}dx$.
The divisor of this is then $(i-j)D_0 -(i-j)D_\infty + R - 2D_\infty$.
Then if $i-j = -1$ this has poles at at all points supported at by $D_0$ and $D_\infty$.


If $p=2$ and $\infty$ is not a branch point then we need to consider the defining equation $y^2 - h(x)y = f(x)$ where $\deg(h)=g+1$, and $\deg(f)$ can be anything from 0 to $2g+2$.
From work (which I think was not in 18 month report), if we suppose that $P_\infty$ and $P_\infty'$ are the two points in the pre-image of $\infty \in \mathbb P_k^1$, then the divisor of $y$ is
\[
\di(y) = \di_0(y) +(g+1 - \deg(f))[P_\infty] - (g+1)[P_\infty'],
\]
up to parity of $P_\infty$ and $P_\infty'$.
So then, after some computation, we get
\begin{multline*}
\di\left(\frac{yx^{i-j}}{H(x)}dx \right) = \di_0(y) + (i-j)D_0 + (g-1-(i-j))D_\infty \\ + (g+1-\deg(f))D_\infty -(g+1)[P_\infty'].
\end{multline*}
So if $i-j = -1$ we clearly have a pole of order 1 at $P_\infty'$.
\end{note}

Now a short note about whether the main theorem still holds if we do not specify the ramification points.
\begin{note}
Clearly when $p\neq 2$ the same basis holds. In the proof we use the fact that $\phi_i$ has a factor of at least $x^{g+1}$, giving a sufficient zero at $P_0$.
This factor is still in the polynomial if we increase its potential degree.
Of course, we may have to replace $P_0$ with $D_0$, but the essential point still holds.
Similarly, after possibly replacing $P_\infty$ by $D_\infty$ we have almost the same argument for $\psi_i$.
So the basis is the same when $p\neq2$.

When $p=2$ the basis is also the same.
We first note that whilst the degree of the highest and lowest ordered terms may change in \eqref{Split}, it is still the case that the coefficient $B_i^i =0$, using exactly the same arguments.
This allows us to use essentially the same arguments, again with the exception of changing $P_\infty$ and $P_0$ to $D_\infty$ and $D_0$.
