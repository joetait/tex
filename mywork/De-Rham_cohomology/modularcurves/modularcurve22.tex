\section{Note on de-Rham cohomology}
We let $X$ be the hyperelliptic curve over an algebraically closed field $k$ (characteristic not 2) defined by $y^2 = f(x)$, where $f(x) \in k[x]$ has no repeated roots.
We let $\pi \colon X \ra \mathbb P^1_k$ be the canonical projection.\todo{rewrite this line}
In previous work we found a basis for the de-Rham cohomology of any hyperelliptic curve using \cech cohomology.
In particular, we let $\cU = \{ U_0 , U_\infty\}$ (recall that $U_a = X\backslash \pi^{-1}(a)$ and a basis of $\cechderhamhone(\cU)$ is given in \cite{derhamactions}.
However, when we are computing actions on particular curves we will often find that the cover $\cU$ is not preserved under the action of particular elements of the automorphism group.
To accommodate for this we will need to extend\todo{alternative word} our cover by at least one open set.
The elements of $G= Aut(X)$\todo{make "Aut" an operator} we will be considering will always fix $U_\infty$, so if $\sigma$ is the element we are considering we will need only add $\sigma^{-1}(U_0)$, which we will denote $U_\sigma$.
We call the cover with this additional element $\cU'' = \{U_0, U_\infty, \sigma^{-1}(U_0)\}$, and we let $\cU' = \{U_\infty, \sigma^{-1}(U_0)\}$.
We then have the following commutative diagram
\[
\begin{array}{ccc}
\derhamhone \cong \cechderhamhone(\cU)  & \xleftarrow{\rho} & \cechderhamhone(\cU'')  \\
\sigma\uparrow & ~ & \rho'\downarrow  \\
\derhamhone \cong \cechderhamhone(\cU)  & \xrightarrow{\sigma} & \cechderhamhone(\cU')
\end{array}
\]
where $\rho$ and $\rho'$ are the canonical projections.
To define these explicitly we recall that $\cechderhamhone(\cU'')$ can be defined is the $k$ vector space \todo{hyphenate this?}
\begin{multline}
\left\{ (\omega_0, \omega_\infty , \omega_\sigma, f_{0\infty}, f_{0 \sigma},f_{\infty \sigma}) | \omega_i \in \Omega_X(U_i), f_{ij} \in \cO_X(U_i \cap U_j), \right. \\ \left. f_{0\infty} - f_{01} + f_{\infty1} = 0, df_{ij} = \omega_i - \omega_j \right\}
\end{multline}
quotiented by the subspace 
\[
\left\{ df_0, df_\infty, df_\sigma, f_0- f_\infty, f_0 - f_\sigma, f_\infty - f_\sigma | f_i \in \cO_X(U_i)\right\}.
\]
Then $\rho$ projects the first, second and fourth co-ordinate \todo{hyphen?} whilst $\rho'$ projects the second, third and sixth co-ordinate.

Suppose that $(\omega_\infty , \omega_\sigma, f_{\infty \sigma})$ is an element of $\cechderhamhone(\cU')$.
Then 
\[
v= (\sigma(\omega_\infty), \sigma(\omega_\sigma), \sigma(f_{\infty \sigma})) \in \Omega_X(U_\infty) \times \Omega_X(U_0) \times \cO_X(U_\infty \cap U_0).
\]
Moreover, since $\sigma(f_{\infty \sigma}) = \sigma(\omega_\infty - \omega_\sigma) =\sigma(\omega_\infty) - \sigma(\omega_\sigma)$, it follows that $v \in \cechderhamhone(\cU)$.
However, this is a different presentation of $\cechderhamhone(\cU)$ than that which we have used previously: we have permuted the order of the first two entries, giving
\[
\frac{ \left\{ (\omega_\infty, \omega_0, f_{\infty 0}) | \omega_\in\Omega_X(U_i), f_{\infty 0}\in \cO_X(U_\infty \cap U_0), df_{\infty 0} = \omega_\infty - \omega_0 \right\} } {\left\{ (df_\infty, df_0, f_\infty - f_0 | f_i \in \cO_X(U_i) \right\} }.
\]
There is a canonical isomorphism between these two presentations, namely $(\omega_\infty, \omega_0, f_{\infty 0}) \mapsto (\omega_0, \omega_\infty, -f_{0 \infty})$.
Combining this isomorphism with the action of sigma we obtain a map 
\[
\sigma\colon \cechderhamhone(\cU') \ra \cechderhamhone(\cU),\  (\omega_\infty, \omega_\sigma, f_{\infty \sigma}) \mapsto (\sigma(\omega_\sigma), \sigma(\omega_\infty), -\sigma(f_{\infty \sigma})).
\]
When we refer to group elements acting on $\derhamhone$ then this is the action we will referring to.


\section{$X_0(22)$}

We suppose that $k$ is a field of characteristic three and that $X$ is the curve defined by
\begin{align*}
y^2 = f(x)  & = (x^3 + x^2 + 2x + 1)(x^3 + 2x^2 + x + 1)\\
& = x^6 + 2x^4 + x^3 + 2x^2 + 1.
\end{align*}
As in \cite[Table 2]{automorphismshyperellipticmodular}, this is the modular curve $X_0(22)$, and has genus 2.
We see from \cite[Table 1]{automorphismshyperellipticmodular} that the automorphism group of this curve is $D_6$, the dihedral group of order 12.
In \cite[\S 3.3]{automorphismshyperellipticmodular} we see that this can be written in the form $C_2 \rtimes (C_2 \times C_3)$, where the cyclic groups of order two are generated by
\begin{align*}
\sigma_1 & \colon (x,y) \mapsto (x,-y) \\
\sigma_2 & \colon (x,y) \mapsto \left( \frac{1}{x}, \frac{2y}{x^3} \right)
\end{align*}
respectively (the description of the action is given in \cite[Table 1]{automorphismshyperellipticmodular}).

We see from \cite[\S 3.3]{automorphismshyperellipticmodular} that to describe how the element of order three acts we need our defining equation to be of the form
\[
y^2 = \sum_{i=0}^3 a_{2i}x^{2i}.
\]
If we consider a function field $k(x,y)$, with some relation on $y^2$, then the map sending $x$ to $x-1$ is an isomorphism.
If we apply this map to $K(X)$, the function field of $X$, we get that
\begin{equation}\label{int}
y^2 = x^6 + 2x^4 + 2x^2 + 2.
\end{equation}
If $g(x) = a_sx^s + \ldots + a_0$ where $a_0 \neq 0 \neq a_s$, then we define $g^*(x) = a_0^{-1}x^sf\left( \frac{1}{x} \right)$.
Applying this to \eqref{int} we get $x^6 + x^4 + x^2 + 2$.
Since this is function we will be using we relabel $f(x)$ so that $y^2 = f(x) = x^6 + x^4 + x^2 + 2$, and we henceforth let $X$ be the curve defined by this equation (which is isomorphic to our previous curve).
We check that this equation has no double roots, and hence is actually a hyperelliptic curve, by computing $f'(x) = x^3 + 2x$. 
We then notice that $f(x) = f'(x)^2 + 2$, and hence $f(x)$ and $f'(x)$ are coprime, and hence share no roots.
In particular, this implies that $f(x)$ has no repeated, hence $X$ is a hyperelliptic curve.

Moreover, since it is clear that both $f'(x+1) = f'(x)$ we see that
\[
f(x+1) = f'(x+1)^2 + 2 = f'(x)^2 + 2 = f(x).
\]
Hence $y^2 = f(x)$ is invariant under the action $\sigma \colon x \mapsto x+1$, and in particular this means that if we let $\sigma(y) = y$ then $\sigma$ is a well defined automorphism of $X$, of order three.


Now we wish to see how our element of order three acts on $\derhamhone$ of our curve.
However, since the basis we have already computed in \cite[Thm. 2.3]{derhamactions} is not stable under this action (in particular, the open set $U_0$ is not preserved) we must refine our cover.
Since $\sigma(U_0) = U_1$ we add the open set $U_1$ to our cover and compute a basis of the de Rham cohomology with respect to this new cover.
We let $\cU' = \{ U_\infty, U_1\}$ and $\cU'' = \cU \cup \cU' = \{U_0, U_1, U_\infty\}$.
Note that $\cechderhamhone(\cU')$ can be written in the same form as $\cechderhamhone(\cU)$ in \cite[Pg. 2]{derhamactions}, after changing the appropriate subscripts.
On the other hand, we write $\cechderhamhone(\cU'')$ as the vector space
\begin{multline}\label{sixtupleconditions}
\left\{ (\omega_0, \omega_\infty , \omega_1, f_{0\infty}, f_{01},f_{\infty 1}) | \omega_i \in \Omega_X(U_i), f_{ij} \in \cO_X(U_i \cap U_j), \right. \\ \left. f_{0\infty} - f_{01} + f_{\infty1} = 0, df_{ij} = \omega_i - \omega_j \right\}
\end{multline}
quotiented by the subspace 
\[
\left\{ df_0, df_\infty, df_1, f_0- f_\infty, f_0 - f_1, f_\infty - f_1 | f_i \in \cO_X(U_i)\right\}.
\]
The following proposition will allow us to compute how $\sigma$ acts on $\cechderhamhone(\cU)$, as in \cite[\S 3]{canonicalrepresentation}.
\begin{prop}\label{basis22}
The residue classes of
\[
\nu_1 = \left(\frac{1}{yx^2}dx, \frac{x^4 + 2x^2}{y}dx, \frac{x^4 + 2x^3 +  2x^2}{2y(x-1)^3}dx, \frac{y}{x}, \frac{y}{x(x-1)^2}, \frac{2y(x+1)}{(x-1)^2} \right)
\]
and
\[
\nu_2 = \left( \frac{x^2 + 1}{2yx^3}, \frac{2x^3}{y}dx, \frac{x^3 + x^2 + x+ 1}{2y(x-1)^3}dx, \frac{y}{x^2}, \frac{x(y +1)}{x^2(x-1)^2}, \frac{2y}{(x-1)^2} \right)
\]
are well defined elements of $\cechderhamhone(\cU'')$.
Moreover, the canonical projections on to $\cechderhamhone(\cU)$ are the first two basis elements described in \cite[Thm. 2.3]{derhamactions}.
\end{prop}
\begin{proof}
We let $\omega_{ji}$ and $f_{jki}$ be the elements of $\nu_i$, so that
\[
\nu_i = (\omega_{0i}, \omega_{\infty i}, \omega_{1i}, f_{0\infty i}, f_{01i}, f_{\infty 1 i} ).
\]
We first show that the first, second and fourth entry of both $\nu_1$ and $\nu_2$ are those described in \cite[Thm. 2.2]{derhamactions}.
It will then follow that they satisfy the relevant conditions of \eqref{sixtupleconditions}.

First note that $f'(x) = x^3 + 2x$, and hence
\[
s_1(x) = xf'(x) + f(x) = x^6 + 2x^4 + 2 \qquad s_2(x) = xf'(x) - f(x) = 2x^6 + x^2 +1.
\]
Recall that we defined $\psi_i(x)$ and $\phi_i(x)$ to the be the unique polynomials in $k[x]$ summing to $s_i$ such that $\psi_i(x)$ is degree at most $g+1$ and $x^{g+2}$ divides $\phi_i(x)$.
Since $g=2$ it follows that
\[
\psi_1(x) = 2 \qquad {\rm and}\qquad \phi_1(x) = x^6 + 2x^4
\]
and that
\[
\psi_2(x) = x^2 +1 \qquad {\rm and} \qquad \phi_2(x) = 2x^6.
\]

Hence
\[
\omega_{01} = \frac{\psi_1(x)}{2yx^2}dx = \frac{1}{yx^2}dx
\]
and
\[
\omega_{\infty 1} = \frac{-\phi_1(x)}{2yx^2}dx = \frac{x^4+2x^2}{y}dx.
\]
On the other hand
\[
\omega_{02} = \frac{\psi_2(x)}{2yx^3}dx = \frac{x^2+1}{2yx^3}dx
\]
and
\[
\omega_{\infty 2} = \frac{-\phi_2(x)}{2yx^3}dx = \frac{2x^3}{y}dx.
\]

We then show that the rest of the conditions are also satisfied, starting with $\nu_i$.
We first check that the elements are regular on the appropriate sets by computing their divisors, which are as follows
\begin{align*}
\di \left( \frac{x^4 + 2x^3 + x^2}{2y(x-1)^3}dx \right)  = & \di(x^4 + 2x^3 + x^2) -3\di(x-1) - \di(y) + \di(dx) \\
= &\di_0(x^4 + 2x^3 + x^2) - 4D_\infty + 3D_\infty  - R +3D_\infty\\
&  -3D_1 +R - 2D_\infty \\
= & \di_0(x^4 + 2x^3 + x^2) - 3D_1;
\end{align*}
\begin{align*}
\di \left(\frac{y}{x(x-1)^2} \right) & = \di(y) - \di(x) - 2\di(x-1) \\
& = R - 3D_\infty - D_0 + D_\infty - 2D_1 + 2D_\infty \\
& = R - D_0 - 2D_1;
\end{align*}
\begin{align*}
\di \left( \frac{2y(x+1)}{(x-1)^2} \right) & = \di(y) + \di(x+1) - 2\di(x-1) \\
& = R - 3D_\infty +D_1 - D_\infty - 2D_1 + 2D_\infty \\
& = R + D_1 - 2D_\infty - 2D_1.
\end{align*}
These are clearly non-negative on $U_1$, $U_0 \cap U_1$ and $U_\infty \cap U_1$ respectively.

Once we note that 
\[
\frac{y}{x(x-1)^2} = \frac{y}{x} -\left(\frac{y}{x-1} - \frac{y}{(x-1)^2} \right)
\]
and that
\[
\frac{2y(x+1)}{(x-1)^2} = -\left( \frac{y}{x-1} - \frac{y}{(x-1)^2}\right)
\]
then it is clear that
\[
\frac{y}{x} - \frac{y}{x(x-1)^2} + \frac{2y(x+1)}{(x-1)^2} = 0.
\]

Now we check the other relations, starting with
\begin{align}
d \left( \frac{y(x+1)}{(x-1)^2} \right) & = \frac{x+1}{(x-1)^2}dy + y d \left( \frac{x+1}{(x-1)^2} \right) \\
& = \frac{f'(x+1)}{2y(x-1)^2}dx - \frac{yx}{(x-1)^3} dx \\
& = \frac{f'(x^2-1) +fx}{2y(x-1)^3}dx \\
& = \frac{x^7 + 2x^5 + 2x^3}{2y(x-1)^3}dx
\end{align}
and
\begin{align}
\omega_{\infty 1} - \omega_{11} & = \frac{x^4 + 2x^2}{y}dx - \frac{x^4 + 2x^3 + 2x^2}{2y(x-1)^3} dx \\
& = \frac{2(x^4 + 2x^2)(x-1)^3 + 2x^4 + x^3 + x^2}{2y(x-1)^3}dx \\
& = \frac{2x^7 + x^5 + x^3}{2y(x-1)^3}dx\\
& = 2d \left( \frac{y(x+1)}{(x-1)^2}\right).
\end{align}
Hence 
\[
df_{\infty 1 1} = \omega_{\infty 1} - \omega_{1 1}.
\]

Similarly we have
\begin{align}
df_{0 1 1} & = d \left( \frac{y}{x(x-1)^2} \right) \\
& = \frac{1}{x(x-1)^2}dy + y d \left( \frac{1}{x(x-1)^2} \right) \\
& = \frac{f'}{2yx(x-1)^2}dx + \frac{y}{x^2(x-1)^3}dx \\
& = \frac{2x^6 + x^5 + x^4 + 2x^3 + 1}{2yx^2(x-1)^3} dx\\
& = \frac{2(x^3-1)}{2yx^2(x-1)^3}dx - \frac{x^6 + 2x^5 + 2x^4}{2yx^2(x-1)^3}dx \\
& = \omega_{01} - \omega_{11}.
\end{align}
So we know that our first element is an element of $\derhamhone (\cU'')$.

We now turn to the second element, where we again start by checking that all the differentials and functions are regular on the correct open sets.
We have
\begin{align}
\di \left( \frac{x^3 + x^2 + x + 1}{2y(x-1)^3} dx \right) = & \di(x^3+x^2+x+1) -\di(y) - 3\di(x-1) + \di(dx) \\
= & \di_0(x^3 + x^2 + x + 1) - 3D_\infty - R + 3D_\infty - 3D_1 \\
& + 3D_\infty + R - 2D_\infty \\
 = &  \di_0(x^3 + x^2 + x + 1) + D_\infty - 3D_1
\end{align}
which is clearly non-negative on $U_1$.
Similarly
\begin{align}
\di \left( \frac{y(x+1)}{x^2(x-1)^2} \right) & = \di(y) + \di(x+1) - 2\di(x) - \di(x-1) \\
& = R - 3D_\infty + D_{-1} -D_\infty -2D_0 + 2D_\infty - 2D_1 + 2D_\infty \\
& = R + D_{-1} - 2D_0 - 2D_1
\end{align}
and
\begin{align}
\di \left( \frac{2y}{(x-1)^2} \right) & = \di(y) - 2\di(x-1) \\
& = R - 3D_\infty - 2D_1 + 2D_\infty \\
& = R - D_\infty - 2D_1,
\end{align}
are non-negative on $U_0 \cap U_1$ and $U_1 \cap U_\infty$ respectively.

It is also obvious that
\[
f_{0 \infty 2} - f_{0 1 2 } + f_{\infty 1 2} = \frac{y}{x^2} - \left( \frac{y}{x^2} - \frac{y}{(x-1)^2} \right) + \frac{2}{(x-1)^2} = 0.
\]

We finally check the relations between the functions and differentials, starting with
\begin{align}
df_{0 1 2} & = \frac{1}{2yx^3(x-1)^3} (x(x-1)(x+1)f' + f)dx \\
& = \frac{1}{2yx^3(x-1)^3}(2x^6 + 2x^4 + 2x^2 + 2)dx \\
& = \frac{1}{2yx^3(x-1)^3}((x^5 + x^3 + 2x^2 + 2) + 2(x^6 + x^5 + x^4 + x^3))dx \\
& = \omega_{02} - \omega_{12}.
\end{align}
We also have
\begin{align}
df_{\infty 1 2} & = \frac{1}{2y(x-1)^3}(f-(x-1)f')dx \\
& = \frac{1}{2y(x-1)^3}(x^6 + x^3 + 2x^2 + 2x+ 2)dx \\
& = \frac{1}{2y(x-1)^3}(x^3(x-1)^3 - x^3 - x^2 - x - 1) dx \\
& = \left(\frac{x^3}{2y} - \frac{x^3 + x^2 + x+1}{2y(x-1)^3}\right) dx \\
& = \omega_{\infty 2} - \omega_{12},
\end{align}
which completes the proof.

\end{proof}

We are now in a position to study the group action on $\cechderhamhone(\cU)$.
First note that $\sigma(U_\infty) = U_\infty$, so this part of the cover $\cU$ is preserved.
However, we can easily see that $\sigma(U_0) = U_1$, and hence we have the following commutative diagram
\[
\begin{array}{ccc}
\derhamhone \cong \cechderhamhone(\cU)  & \xleftarrow{\rho} & \cechderhamhone(\cU'')  \\
\sigma\uparrow & ~ & \rho'\downarrow  \\
\derhamhone \cong \cechderhamhone(\cU)  & \xrightarrow{\sigma} & \cechderhamhone(\cU')
\end{array}
\]

Since the image $\sigma (U_0)$ is equal to $U_1$ it follows that $\sigma$ will map from $\derhamhone(\cU')$ to $\derhamhone(\cU)$, and hence we can compute the group action by studying $\sigma \colon (\omega_{2i}, \omega_{3i}, f_{23i}) \mapsto (\sigma(\omega_{3i}), \sigma (\omega_{2i}), \sigma(f_{23i}))$.

In particular
\begin{equation}\label{sigmanu1}
\sigma(\nu_1) = \left( \frac{x^4+2x^2+2x+2}{2yx^3}dx, \frac{x^4+x^3+2x^2+2x}{y}dx, \frac{y(x+2)}{x^2} \right)
\end{equation}
and
\[
\sigma(\nu_2) = \left( \frac{x^3+x^2+1}{2yx^3}dx, \frac{x^3+1}{2y}dx, \frac{y}{x^2} \right).
\]
Since we change the order of the differentials, we also need to change the sign of the function after the action of $\sigma$ has been applied.\todo[inline]{Check that changing the sign of the function is correct}
Note that $dx$ is invariant under the action of $\sigma$, since $\sigma(dx) = d (\sigma (x)) = d(x+1) = dx$.



We wish to write the above elements in terms of the basis elements for $\cechderhamhone(\cU)$ that we have already described.
Recall that this basis is formed of
\begin{align}
\gamma_1  = & \left( \frac{1}{y}dx, \frac{1}{y}dx, 0\right) \\
\gamma_2 = & \left(\frac{x}{y}dx, \frac{x}{y}dx, 0\right) \\
\gamma_3 = & \left( \frac{1}{yx^2}dx, \frac{x^4 + 2x^2}{y}dx, \frac{y}{x} \right)\\
\gamma_4 = & \left(\frac{x^2+1}{2yx^3}dx, \frac{2x^3}{y}dx, \frac{y}{x^2} \right).
\end{align}

Then it is easy to see that
\[
\sigma(\nu_1) = 2 \gamma_2 + 2\gamma_4 + \gamma_3
\]
and similarly
\[
\sigma(\nu_2) = \gamma_4 + 2 \gamma_1.
\]
We then see that the action of $\sigma$ on the curve is not stable.

Now we compute the action of $\sigma$ on $\hone$.
We will then be able to explicitly check whether the short exact sequence splits.

Before computing the action of $\sigma$ on $\hone$ we first note that if we naively map $f$ to $\sigma(f)$ the action is not well defined, since $\sigma$ changes the cover, and hence $\sigma(f)$ is not regular on $U_0\cap U_\infty$, and hence not an element of $\cechhone$.
However, we can use the same technique that we employed to compute the group action of $\sigma$ on $\derhamhone$.
Namely, we compute elements of $\cechhone (\cU'')$ that surject on the $\cechhone(\cU)$, and then we study how $\sigma$ acts on the image of these elements in $\cechhone(\cU)$.
It is easy to compute that
\[
\cechhone(\cU'') = \frac{ \{(f_{0\infty}, f_{01}, f_{\infty 1})| f_{i,j} \in \cO_X(U_i \cap U_j), f_{0 \infty} - f_{01} + f_{\infty 1} \} }{ \{ (f_0 - f_\infty , f_0 - f_1, f_\infty - f_1)| f_i \in \cO_X(U_i)\}}.
\]
It is then clear that we can project that last three entries of the elements described in Proposition \ref{basis22} on to $\cechhone(\cU'')$.
However, since we are considering the same elements as those that appear in $\cechderhamhone(\cU'')$ then the group action on the components will be the same.
Hence the action on both the elements of $\cechderhamhone(\cU)$ that project on to $\cechhone(\cU)$, and the elements of 

We saw what the action of $\sigma$ on $\gamma_3$ and $\gamma_4$ was earlier.
It is also easy to see that
\[
\sigma(\gamma_1) = \gamma_1 \ {\rm and} \ \sigma(\gamma_2) = \gamma_1 + \gamma_2.
\]
We can then compute whether it is possible for the short exact sequence \todo{reference ses} splits.
Suppose there is a map $s\colon \hone \ra \derhamhone$ such that$p \circ s  = {\rm id} \colon \hone \ra \hone$.
Hence $s(\bar \gamma_3) = \gamma_3 + a_1 \gamma_1 + a_2 \gamma_2$ and $s(\bar \gamma_4) = \gamma_4 + b_1 \gamma_1 + b_2 \gamma_2$, for some $a_i, b_i \in k$.
Obviously $s$ must be a $k[G]$-module homomorphism.
Hence 
\[
\gamma_4 + b_1\gamma_1 + b_2(\gamma_1 + \gamma_2) = \sigma (s(\bar \gamma_4)) = s ( \sigma(\bar \gamma_4)) =  s(\bar \gamma_4) = \gamma_4 + b_1\gamma_1.
\]
Clearly $b_2 = 0$ in this case, so $s(\gamma_4 ) = \gamma_4 + b_1 \gamma_1$.

We also require that $\sigma(s(\bar \gamma_3) = s (\sigma(\bar \gamma_3))$.
On the one hand we have
\[
\sigma(s(\bar \gamma_3)) = \gamma_3 + 2\gamma_4 + 2\gamma_2 + a_1\gamma_1 + a_2(\gamma_2 + \gamma_1) = (a_1 +a_2)\gamma_1 + (a_2 + 2)\gamma_2 + \gamma_3 + 2\gamma_4
\]
whilst on the other hand we have
\[
s(\sigma( \bar \gamma_3)) = s(\bar \gamma_3 + 2 \bar \gamma_4) = \gamma_3 + a_1 \gamma_1 + a_2 \gamma_2 + 2\gamma_4 + 2b_1\gamma_1 = (a_1 + 2b_1)\gamma_1 + a_2\gamma_2 + \gamma_3 + 2\gamma_4.
\]
So for $\sigma(s(\bar \gamma_3) = s (\sigma(\bar \gamma_3))$ to hold we would require $(a_2 + 2)\gamma_2 = a_2\gamma_2$.
Hence such a splitting map $s$ does not exist.




\section{Modular curve $X_0(50)$}
We now consider the modular curve $X_0(50)$.
When $\cha(k) = 3$ we see from \cite[Table 1]{automorphismshyperellipticmodular} that the automorphism group is $D_6$, the dihedral group with 12 elements.
We see from \cite[Table 2]{automorphismshyperellipticmodular} that this has 
\[
y^2 = f(x) = x^6 + 2x^5 + 2x^3 + 2 + 1
\]
as a defining equation.

However, as in the last equation we need to write this in the form $\sum_i=0^3 a_{2i}x^{2i}$ for some $a_i \in k$.
\todo[inline]{Not sure what automorphism can be used to remove the $x^5$ term}
We can deduce this, up to a constant, from the \cite[Table 7]{automorphismshyperellipticmodular}; namely $f(x) = 2x^6 + x^4 +2x^2$.
We can also deduce that the automorphism of order three is $x \mapsto x+i$, where $i^2 = -1$.
Indeed, we can easily verify that $2x^6 + x^4 + 2x^2 = 2(x+i)^6 + (x+i)^4 + 2(x+i)^2$.
However, without being sure of what the constant term is we cannot compute the basis.

\section{Modular curve $X_0(28)$}
Let $k$ be an algebraically closed field of characteristic three.
We now consider the modular curve $X_0(28)$, which by \cite[Table 1]{automorphismshyperellipticmodular} has defining equation 
\begin{align}
y^2 &  = (x^2 + 1)(x^2 + x+2)(x^2+2x+2) \\
& = x^6 + x^4 + x^2 + 1.
\end{align}
We also see from \cite[Table 1]{automorphismshyperellipticmodular} that the automorphism group when $\cha(k) = 3$ is $GL_2(\mathbb F_3)$.

We start by computing explicitly what this action.
\todo[inline]{There appear to be some issues in the case of the generic automorphism group. In Table 1 the group is listed as $D_6$, yet in 3.1 it is claimed that the reduced group is $\ZZ_2$. Also, there are three generators listed in Table 2, but they are all of order 2. Check this with Bernhard}
\todo[inline]{Given that the explicit elements on the generic fibre are all of order two, and that on page 154 it is mentioned that the reduced group on the generic fibre is $D_4$, I am guessing that the automorphism group is meant to be $D_8$ (or $D_4$?)}

Although the automorphism group is said to be $GL_2(\mathbb F_3)$, we need only find one element that acts in the correct way to show that the sequence in \cite{derhamactions} does not split.
We can construct at least one such element in the same way that we did for $X_0(22)$.
We already have our defining equation in the form
\[
y^2 = \sum_{i=0}^3 a_{2i}x^{2i}.
\]
When we compute $f(x+c) - f(x)$ we get $(2c^3+c)x^3 + (c^3 + 2c)x + (c^6 + c^4 + c^2)$.
If we set $c=1$ or $c=2$ then all the coefficients are clearly zero.
So the map $\sigma \colon x \mapsto x-1$ is an isomorphism of our curve.

We now compute what the basis elements of $\derhamhone$ are, using \cite[Thm. 2.3]{derhamactions}.
We first note that if $f(x) = x^6 + x^4 + x^2 +1$ then $f'(x) = x^3 + 2x$.
Hence
\begin{align}
s_1 & = xf'(x) -2f(x) = x^6 + 2x^4 + 1 \\
s_2 & = xf'(x) - f(x) = 2x^6 + x^2 + 2.
\end{align}
Then it follows that the first two basis elements in \cite[Thm. 2.3]{derhamactions} are
\begin{align}
\left( \frac{1}{2yx^2}dx, \frac{2(x^6 + 2x^4)}{2yx^2}dx, \frac{y}{x} \right) & = \left( \frac{1}{2yx^2}dx, \frac{x^4+2x^2}{y}dx, \frac{y}{x} \right) \label{28basisone} \\
\left( \frac{x^2 + 2}{2yx^3}dx, \frac{2(2x^6)}{2yx^3}dx, \frac{y}{x^2} \right) & = \left( \frac{x^2 + 2}{2yx^3}dx, \frac{2x^3}{y}dx, \frac{y}{x^2} \right). \label{28basistwo}
\end{align}

As in the $X_0(22)$ case, we need to refine our cover, since the open set $U_0$ is not closed under the action of $\sigma$.
In particular, we let $\cU' = \{U_\infty, U_{1} \}$ and $\cU'' = \cU \cup \cU'$.
Then we wish to find elements of $\cechderhamhone(\cU'')$ that surject on to \eqref{28basisone} and \eqref{28basistwo}.

\todo[inline]{Rough work from here - here be dragons}
We first posit that
\[
\nu_1 = \left( \frac{1}{2yx^2}dx, \frac{x^4+2x^2}{y}dx, \frac{x^4 + 2x^3 + 2x^2 + 2x}{2y(x-1)^3}dx, \frac{y}{x}, \frac{y}{x(x-1)^2}, \frac{-y(x+1)}{(x-1)^2} \right)
\]
is such an element.
We start by checking that the alternating sum of the functions is zero:
\begin{equation*}
\frac{y}{x} - \frac{y}{x(x-1)^2} - \frac{y(x+1)}{(x-1)^2}  = \frac{y(x-1)^2 - y - yx(x+1)}{x(x-1)^2} = 0
\end{equation*}

We next check that the third differential is regular on the correct open set, as follows:
\begin{align*}
\di \left( \frac{x^4 + 2x^3 + 2x^2 + 2x}{2y(x-1)^3}dx \right) = & 3D_\infty -R +3D_\infty -3D_1 +\di_0(x^4+2x^3+2x^2+2x) \\
&  -4D_\infty +R -2D_\infty \\
= & \di_0(x^4 + 2x^3 + 2x^2 + 2x) - 3D_1.
\end{align*}
Clearly this is positive on $U_1$, as desired.

We now verify the other relations, starting with
\begin{align*}
df_{0 1 1} & = d \left( \frac{y}{x(x-1)^2} \right) \\
& = \frac{1}{x(x-1)^2}dy + y d \left( \frac{1}{x(x-1)^2} \right) \\
& = \frac{f'}{2yx(x-1)^2}dx + \frac{y}{(x-1)^3x^2}dx \\
& = \frac{1}{2yx^2(x-1)^3}\left( f'x(x-1) +2f\right)dx \\
& = \frac{1}{2yx^2(x-1)^3}(2x^6+x^5+x^4+2x^3+2)dx \\
& = \omega_{0 1} - \omega_{1 1}.
\end{align*}
Similarly
\begin{align*}
df_{\infty 1} & = d \left( \frac{2y(x+1)}{(x-1)^2} \right) \\
& = 2yd\left( \frac{x+1}{(x-1)^2} \right) + \frac{2(x+1)}{(x-1)^2}dy \\
& = \frac{yx}{(x-1)^3} dx + \frac{f'(x+1)}{y(x-1)^2}dx \\
& = \frac{1}{y(x-1)^3}(fx + f'(x^2-1))dx \\
& = \frac{1}{y(x-1)^3} (x^7 + 2x^5 + 2x^3 + 2x)dx \\
& = \frac{(x^7 + 2x^5 + 2x^4 +x^2) + (x^4 + 2x^3 + 2x^2 + 2x)}{y(x-1)^3} dx \\
& = \frac{(x^4+2x^2)(x-1)^3}{y(x-1)^3}dx - \frac{x^4+2x^3+2x^2+2x}{2y(x-1)^3}dx \\
& = \omega_2 - \omega_3,
\end{align*}
concluding our proof that $\nu_1$ is an element of $\cechderhamhone(\cU'')$.

We next show that
\[
\nu_2 = \left( \frac{x^2+2}{2yx^3}dx, \frac{2x^3}{y}dx, \frac{x^3+x^2+x+2}{2y(x-1)^3}dx, \frac{y}{x^2}, \frac{y(x+1)}{x^2(x-1)^2}, \frac{2y}{(x-1)^2} \right) 
\]
is also an element of $\cechderhamhone(\cU')$.
Note that $\nu_1$ and $\nu_2$ are linearly independent.

Firstly
\[
s_2(x) = xf'(x) - f(x) = 2x^6 + x^2 +2,
\]
and hence
\[
\psi_2 = x^2 + 2 \ {\rm and} \ \phi_2 = 2x^6.
\]
We then conclude
\[
\frac{\psi_2(x)}{2yx^3}dx = \frac{x^2+2}{2yx^3}dx \ {\rm and} \ \frac{-\psi_2}{2yx^3}dx = \frac{2x^3}{y}dx.
\]

We now check that $df_{0 1 2} = \omega_{0 2} - \omega_{1 2}$ as follows
\begin{align*}
df_{0 1 2} & = d\left(\frac{y(x+1)}{x^2(x-1)^2} \right) \\
& = \frac{x+1}{x^2(x-1)^2}dy + y d\left( \frac{x+1}{x^2(x-1)^2} \right) \\
& = \frac{f'(x)(x+1)}{2yx^2(x-1)^2} dx - \frac{y}{x^3(x-1)^3}dx \\
& = \frac{f'(x)x(x^2-1) + f(x)}{2yx^3(x-1)^3}dx \\
& = \frac{2x^6 + 2x^4 + 2x^2 +1}{2yx^3(x-1)^3} dx \\
& = \frac{(x^5 + 2x^3 + 2x^2 + 1) + 2x^3(x^3 + x^2 + x + 2)}{2yx^3(x-1)^3}dx \\
& = \omega_1 - \omega_3.
\end{align*}

Similarly we see that $df_{\infty 1 2} = \omega_{\infty 2} - \omega_{1 2}$:
\begin{align*}
df_{\infty 1 2} & = d \left( \frac{2y}{(x-1)^2} \right) \\
& = 2y d\left( \frac{1}{(x-1)^2} \right) + \frac{2}{(x-1)^2} dy \\
& = \frac{2y}{(x-1)^3}dx + \frac{f'(x)}{y(x-1)^2}dx \\
& = \frac{2f(x) + (x-1)f'(x)}{y(x-1)^3} dx \\
& = \frac{2x^6 + 2x^3 + x^2 + x + 2}{y(x-1)^3} dx \\
& = \frac{2x^3(x-1)^3 + (x^3 + x^2 + x + 2)}{y(x-1)^3}dx \\
& = \omega_{\infty 2} - \omega_{12}.
\end{align*}

These project down to 
\[
\eta_1 = \left( \frac{x^4 + 2x^2}{y}dx , \frac{x^4 + 2x^3 + 2x^2 + 2x}{2y(x-1)^3}dx, \frac{2y(x+1)}{(x-1)^2} \right)
\]
and
\[
\eta_2 = \left(\frac{2x^3}{y}dx, \frac{x^3+x^2+x+2}{2y(x-1)^3}dx, \frac{2y}{(x-1)^2} \right).
\]

The basis of $\cechderhamhone (\cU)$ as given in \cite{derhamactions} can be written more explicitly as 
\begin{align*}
\alpha_1 & = \left( \frac{1}{y}dx, \frac{1}{y}dx, 0 \right) \\
\alpha_2 & = \left( \frac{x}{y}dx, \frac{x}{y}dx, 0 \right) \\
\alpha_3 & = \left( \frac{1}{2yx^2}dx, \frac{x^4 + 2x^2}{y}dx, \frac{y}{x} \right) \\
\alpha_4 & = \left( \frac{x^2 + 2}{2yx^3}dx, \frac{2x^3}{y}dx, \frac{y}{x^2} \right)
\end{align*}

We first compute the action of $\sigma$ on $\eta_1$ and $\eta_2$, which is as follows:
\[
\sigma(\eta_1) = \left( \frac{x^4 + 2x^2 + x +1}{2yx^3}dx, \frac{x^4 + x^3 + 2x^2 + 2x}{y}dx, \frac{2y(x+2)}{x^2} \right) 
\]
and
\[
\sigma(\eta_2) = \left( \frac{x^3 + 2x^2 +2x}{2yx^3}, \frac{2x^3 + 2}{y}dx, \frac{2y}{x^2} \right).
\]

Up to the sign of the third term then 
\[
\sigma(\eta_1) = 2\alpha_2 + \alpha_4 + 2\alpha_2.
\]
