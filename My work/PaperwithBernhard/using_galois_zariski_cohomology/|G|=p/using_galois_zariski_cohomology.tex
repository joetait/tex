\maketitle
Let $X$ be a smooth connected projective algebraic curve over an algebraically closed field $k$ of charactersitic $p>0$.
Suppose that $G$ is a cyclic group of prime order $l$ (not equal $p$) which acts faithfully on $X$.
We denote by $Y$ the quotient curve $X/G$, and by $\pi$ the canonical projection $X\rightarrow Y$.
Then let $K_X$ and $K_Y$ denote the canonical divisors of $X$ and $Y$ respectively, and similarly let $g_X$ and $g_Y$ denote the genera of the curves.
Moreover, we assume that $g_X\geq 2$ and that $g_Y = 0$.


We wish to use \citep[Thm 4.5]{galiosstruc} to find when $G$ acts trivially on $H^0(X,\Omega^{\otimes m})$.
In order to do this we will first need to introduce some notation.

We first denote by $\chi_P$ the representation of the decomposition group $G_P$ on the cotangent space $\mathfrak{m}_P/\mathfrak{m}_P^2$.
We also introduce the unique projective module $N_{G,X}$ satisfying
\begin{equation*}
 \bigoplus^l N_{G,X} = \bigoplus_{P\in X} \bigoplus_{d=1}^{e^t_p-1} \bigoplus^d {\rm Ind}_{G_P}^G(\chi_P^d),
\end{equation*}

where $e^t_p$ denotes that (tame) ramification index at a point $P\in X$, as in \citep[Thm 4.3]{galiosstruc}.

Fix an integer $m\geq 2$. Now if we write $mK_X = \sum_{P\in X} n_P[P]$ then we can define $r_P\in \{0,\ldots, e^t_p - 1\}$ and $s_P\in \ZZ$ to be the unique values such that
\[
 n_P = r_P + s_Pe_P^t.
\]

Finally, if for any $Q\in Y$ we let $\bar Q \in X$ be an element of the fibre with respect to $\pi$, we can state \citep[Thm 4.5]{galiosstruc}, which says that we have the following equality in $K_0(k[G])$:
\begin{equation}\label{eq}
 \chi(G,X,\Omega^{\otimes m}) = -[N_{G,X}] +\sum_{Q\in Y}\sum^{r_{\bar Q}}_{d=1} [{\rm Ind}_{G_{\bar Q}}^G(\chi_{\bar Q}^d)]  + \left( 1 + \sum_{Q\in Y} s_{\bar Q} \right) [k[G]],
\end{equation}
where for any $k[G]$ module $A$ then $[A]$ denotes that class of $A$ in $K_0[k[G]]$.

We wish to find when the action of $G$ on $H^0(X,\Omega^{\otimes m})$ is trival.
Note that $[H^0(X,\Omega^{\otimes m})]$ is in the same class as $\chi(G,X,\Omega^{\otimes m})$ in $K_0(k[G])$, since $mK_X$ is non-special under our assumptions.
Hence the action will be trivial precisely when we have equality between the dimension and the fixed dimension.
However, rather than compute this in its entirety we will look at the weaker question of when each component of the right hand side of \ref{eq} has dimension equal to its fixed dimension.
We will see that even this can only tell us that $l=2$ and that $m$ is either odd or 2.


Before we look at the first two parts, we recall from \citep[Rem. 4.30]{introtoreps} that for a representation $V$ of a group $G$ and a subgroup $H\subseteq G$ we have
\[
  \dim \rm{Ind}_H^G(V) = \dim(V)\cdot\frac{|G|}{|H|}.
\]

Since our group is of prime order, any subgroup is either trivial, or the whole group.
If $G_P = G$ then $G$ acts trivially on $P$, and $P$ is a ramification point, and has ramification index $l=|G|$.
In the other case, when $G_P$ is trivial, then $P$ is unramified, and has ramification index one.
Now in both $N_{G,X}$ and $\sum_{Q\in Y}\sum^{r_{\bar Q}}_{d=1} {\rm Ind}_{G_P}^G(\chi_P^d)$ we sum over all the points in $X$ and $Y$ respectively, and then we sum to one less than their ramification index.
So we have $\dim {\rm Ind}_{G_P}^G(\chi_P^d) = \dim \chi_P^d = 1$ for all contributing components.

Following this we can write 
\[
 l\cdot \dim N_{G,X} = \sum_{P\in X} \sum_{d=1}^{e^t_P -1} d\cdot \dim {\rm Ind}_{G_P}^G\chi_P^d = \sum_{P\ \rm{ ramified}} \sum_{d=1}^{l -1} d
\]
since the dimension of $\chi^d_P$ is $1$.
Hence
\[
 \dim N_{G,X} = \sum_{P\ \rm{ ramified}}  \frac{l-1}{2}.
\]

Now the fixed dimension of $\chi^d_P$ is precisely 0 for $d>0$, and hence we also have
\[
 l\cdot \dim N_{G,X}^G = \sum_{P\ \rm{ ramified}} \sum_{d=1}^{l-1} 0 = 0.
\]

We now move on to the second term in the sum, and compute its dimension which is
\[
 \dim \left(\sum_{Q\in Y} \sum_{d=1}^{r_{\bar Q}} \rm{Ind}_{G_{\bar Q}}^G (\chi_{\bar Q}^{-d})\right) = \sum_{Q\in Y} \sum_{d=1}^{r_{\bar Q}} 1.
\]
Note that we can sum over all $Q\in Y$, since $r_{\bar Q}$ is zero for all but a finite number of points.
On the other hand the fixed dimension is
\[
 \sum_{Q\in Y} \sum_{d=1}^{r_{\bar Q}} 0 = 0.
\]


Finally, we now compute when 
\[
 \dim \left( 1 + \sum_{Q\in Y} s_{\bar Q} \right) k[G] = l\cdot \left( 1 + \sum_{Q\in Y} s_{\bar Q} \right).
 \]
On the other hand, the fixed dimension is
\[
\dim \left( 1 + \sum_{Q\in Y} s_{\bar Q} \right) k[G]^G = 1 + \sum_{Q\in Y} s_{\bar Q}.
\]

By substituting all of these in to \ref{eq}, we find that the dimension of $H^0(X,\Omega_X^{\otimes m})$ is
\[
 \sum_{P\ {\rm ramified}} \frac{1-l}{2} + \sum_{Q\in Y}\sum_{d=1}^{r_{\bar Q}} 1 + l\cdot \left( 1 + \sum_{Q\in Y} s_{\bar Q} \right),
\]
whilst the dimension of the fixed subspace of $H^0(X,\Omega_X^{\otimes m})$ is just
\[
 1 + \sum_{Q\in Y} s_{\bar Q}.
\]

 Hence the group acts trivially if and only if
\[
 \sum_{P\ {\rm ramified}} \frac{1-l}{2} + \sum_{Q\in Y}\sum_{d=1}^{r_{\bar Q}} 1 + (l-1)\cdot \left( 1 + \sum_{Q\in Y} s_{\bar Q} \right) = 0.
\]

In order to compute this we first need to work out what $r_{\bar Q}$ and $s_{\bar Q}$ are.
Denoting the ramification divisor of $\pi$ by $R$, recall that we can write $mK_X = m \pi^* K_Y + mR$.
Since we are assuming that $g_Y=0$, we can write $K_Y=-2[Q']$ for some unramified point $Q'\in Y$.
Also, we know that $R=\sum_{P\ {\rm ramified}} (l-1)[P]$.
Clearly if $Q$ is not ramified and not $Q'$, then $r_{\bar Q}=s_{\bar Q}=0$.
If $\bar Q \in \pi^{-1}(Q')$ then $-2m = r_{\bar Q} + s_{\bar Q}$.
Finally, if $P$ is a ramified point then $m(l-1)=r_P + s_Pl$.
