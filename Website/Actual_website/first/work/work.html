			<p>
			I will post papers, reports and transcripts of talks here.
			I am currently completing a paper with my supervisor. It significantly extends a short paper he had prepared some time ago, which is available at <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/0911.0625">the Arxiv</a>. We extend this paper by looking at both general divisors of degree at least 2g-2, and also looking at poly-differentials.

			<li><a href="./18month.pdf">Transfer Thesis</a>. This is my (yet to completely finalised) transfer thesis (Southampton University starts everyone on an MPhil course before moving them up to a PhD approximately half way through). It should give a good outline of the work that I have done so far.
