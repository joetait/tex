                <li><a href="http://cms.math.ca/10.4153/CJM-2014-015-2">Faithfulness of actions on Riemann-Roch spaces</a>, to appear in <a href="http://cms.math.ca/cjm/">Canadian Journal of Mathematics</a>. Abstract:
                <div class="graphic_textbox_layout_style_default">
                <p style="padding-top: 0pt; " class="Free_Form">Given a faithful action of a finite group \(G\) on an algebraic curve \(X\) of genus \(g_X\geq 2\), we give explicit criteria for the induced action of \(G\) on the Riemann-Roch space \(H^0(X,\mathcal{O}_X(D))\) to be faithful, where \(D\) is a \(G\)-invariant divisor on \(X\) of degree at least \(2g_X-2\). This leads to a concise answer to the question when the action of \(G\) on the space \(H^0(X, \Omega_X^{\otimes m})\) of global holomorphic polydifferentials of order \(m\) is faithful. If \(X\) is hyperelliptic, we furthermore provide an explicit basis of \(H^0(X, \Omega_X^{\otimes m})\). Finally, we give applications in deformation theory and in coding theory and we discuss the analogous problem for the action of \(G\) on the first homology \(H_1(X, \mathbb{Z}/m\mathbb{Z})\) if \(X\) is a Riemann surface.</p>

                In particular, it should be noted that this is a phenomenon unique to positive characteristic.

		<ul>
			<li><a href="./Mastersproject.pdf">Masters Project</a>. (Unfortunately I do not have a final copy of my masters project, and as such there are some errors. I believe these are all just typos though.)</li>
			<li><a href="./18month.pdf">Transfer Thesis</a>. This is my transfer thesis (Southampton University starts everyone on an MPhil course before moving them up to a PhD approximately half way through). It contains a relatively self-contained proof of the strong Hurwitz formula, using function field theory in the first chapter. The second chapter largely covers the same results as "Faithfulness of action on Riemann-Roch spaces".
